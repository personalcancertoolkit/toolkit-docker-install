He began a collaboration with Dr. Joseph Walther in 1948 when they joined forces to start the Memorial Clinic, which was located in Indianapolis.</p>\n<p>He was appointed to the board of directors of the Walther Cancer Institute (now known as the Walther Cancer Foundation) in 1990 and established the Burdette-Kunkel endowment for direct support of research contributing to a greater understanding of how patients and their families respond to the physical and emotional effects of cancer and its treatment.</p>\n<p>His practice of medicine and support of behavioral research was a direct result of a core belief that a patient\'s environment, behaviors, and family play a major role in health outcomes. Dr. Burdette\'s support of oncology research was also based on his belief that prevention and early detection are the cornerstones in our fight against cancer morbidity and mortality.</p>\n<p>The majority of research now taking place in the Cancer Control and Prevention Program of the Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center was directly supported through endowment funds from the Mary Margaret Walther research program of the Walther Cancer Institute in Indianapolis. Dr. Burdette was the major leader and board supporter of developing and sustaining this important effort.\n</div></div>\n\n<div id=\"symptomtext\">\n<p>The Burdette Cancer Portal is a site dedicated to providing information and education about cancer to everyone, and especially to those impacted by cancer, either as a cancer patient, a caregiver for a cancer patient, or a loved one of a cancer patient.</p>\n\n<p>Much of the inspiration for the Burdette Cancer Portal has come from the Mary Margaret Walther Program for Cancer Care Research of the IU School of Nursing.  The Program is formed around behavioral research in the following areas:<br><ul>\n<li>Prevention and early detection of cancer</li>\n<li>Management of symptoms and side effects of cancer treatment at diagnosis</li>\n<li>Long-term survivorship issues</li>\n<li>Problems patients and families face with advanced cancer</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Scientists and researchers connected to the Walther Program formed the Behavioral Cooperative Oncology Group (BCOG)/Center for Symptom Management.  The BCOG group fosters collaboration among researchers and health care practitioners in the Midwest region.  BCOG\'s work in the field of symptom management research is the basis for much of the information you will find in the symptom management section of this site.</p>\n\n<p>The Burdette Cancer Portal is an effort to take the findings of the BCOG group and provide a platform to foster development and translation of symptom management research to cancer patients and their families.  It is hoped that the information provided by the portal will be accessible to as many people as possible, and that the the ways people find and use the information will provide useful insights into how best to make on-line resources available for cancer patients, caregivers, survivors, and families.</p>\n\n<p>This site is a collaboration between the <a href=\"http://cancer.iu.edu\" target=\"_blank\">Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center</a>, <a href=\"http://www.walther.org\" target=\"_blank\">Walther Cancer Foundation</a>, and the Indiana University <a href=\"http://nursing.iupui.edu\" target=\"_blank\">School of Nursing</a>, <a href=\"http://medicine.iupui.edu\" target=\"_blank\">School of Medicine</a>, and the <a href=\"http://soic.iupui.edu\" target=\"_blank\">School of Informatics and Computing</a>.</p>\n</div>'),

Pairs of patients and caregivers were recruited for the study and asked to complete an 8-week program of symptom reporting for patients, and caregiver concern reporting for caregivers.  The program also involved information for both the patient and caregiver, as well as evaluation questionnaires to assess the usefulness of the information presented each week.</p> \n<h4>Help For Cancer Caregivers</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://helpforcancercaregivers.org\" /><img class=\"left_thumbnail\" src=\"images/hfcc_209.png\"/>Help For Cancer Caregivers</a> is a publicly available website, based on the caregiver resources developed for Pathways For Caring.  Caregivers provide information about their concerns, and information is provided for their priority interests.  The project is a collaboration between IU School of Nursing, IU School of Informatics, CancerCare.org, and Caregiver Action Network.  Funding was provided by Wellpoint Foundation.\n<h4>Escape From Nicotinia</h4>\n<p><img class=\"left_thumbnail\" src=\"images/nicotinia.png\"/>Escape From Nicotinia is a video game project designed to prevent smoking for young girls.  Done in the style of a graphic novel, the game uses a story line that follows a young girl who must make choices to avoid being trapped in Nicotinia, a dreary city with ash-tray architecture, and creepy characters who think they are \"cool\".</p>'),

These include adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma. </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Adenocarcinoma is the most common subtype and usually develops at the edges of the lungs. This is usually slow growing and is frequently found in nonsmokers and women. </li>\r\n  <li>Squamous cell cancers are strongly associated with smoking and are usually found in the larger airways and toward the center of the chest. </li>\r\n  <li>Large cell cancers account for the fewest number in the non-small cell cancer category. Multiple treatment modalities, such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, are available and are recommended according to the stage of your disease. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Small cell lung cancer is less common than non-small cell lung cancer and tends to be more aggressive and is more common in smokers.

As many as half of all cancer patients experience anemia at one time or another. Red blood cells carry hemoglobin, a protein that carries oxygen the body needs for energy.<br /><br />Healthcare providers usually order a blood test, called a complete blood count (CBC), to diagnose anemia. The CBC has three key measures: red blood cell count, hematocrit, and hemoglobin.  A major loss in any of these measures will indicate anemia. Anemia is a primary cause of fatigue related to cancer and cancer treatment. </p><br /><a name=\"2\"></a><h1>How do people describe anemia?</h1><p>Initially, anemia can be so mild it goes unnoticed.  As signs and symptoms increase, the condition becomes worse. Anemia is not often life threatening, but can play a major role in reducing the quality of life of a person with cancer. <br /><br />Many people report the following as signs of anemia: <ul> <li> Pale skin, fingernails, palms, and lining of eyelids. </li> <li> Dizziness. </li> <li> Tiredness. </li> <li> Light headed. </li> <li> Rapid pulse. </li> <li> Rapid heart beat. </li> <li> Fatigue. </li> <li> Chills. </li> <li> Inability to stay warm. </li> <li> Shortness of breath (especially when sitting or standing). </li> <li> Lack of energy. </li> <li> Weakness. </li> <li> Inability to concentrate. </li> <li> Chest pain. </li> <li> Feeling heart beating in chest. </li></ul></p><a name=\"3\"></a><h1>What causes anemia?</h1><p>Anemia can be caused by any one or a combination of the following: <ul> <li> Cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy, surgery, or radiation. </li> <li> Lack of specific vitamins or minerals in the diet. </li> <li> Another chronic disease such as arthritis, kidney disease. </li> <li> Hereditary disorders, such as sickle cell disease. </li> <li> Infiltration of bone marrow with cancer. </li></ul></p><a name=\"4\"></a><h1>What can I do about anemia?</h1><p>In general, it is not possible to prevent anemia during the course of cancer treatment. The severity of anemia depends on the kind of cancer being treated, the medications and doses used to treat it, and the general condition of the person receiving treatment. <br /><br />Here are some tips you might find helpful:<br /><br /><h2>ACTIVITY</h2><ul> <li> Get plenty of rest (8 hours of sleep with several rest periods during the day). </li> <li> Do some mild exercise daily.  Take at least a 15-minute walk each day. (Exercise can increase your energy level.) </li> <li> Schedule your day so that you have time to rest between major activities. </li> <li> Let others help you with housework, chores and meal preparation. </li> <li> Get help with daily activities. </li> <li> Try not to sleep for long periods during the day.  It may interfere with you getting a good night\'s sleep. </li> <li> Place things that you use often within easy reach. </li> <li> Rise slowly after sitting or lying down to prevent dizziness. </li> <li> Plan rest periods to conserve energy for important activities. </li> <li> Set priorities to do important or fun activities first. </li> <li> Change your work schedule.  Consider decreasing your work hours. </li> <li> Take time off from work during the weeks you have treatment. </li></ul><br /><h2>DIET</h2><ul> <li> Eat a diet rich in iron.  Foods rich in iron include red meats and green leafy vegetables. </li> <li> Eat a well balanced diet. </li> <li> Drink 8 (8oz.) glasses of water or other non-caffeinated drinks every day.  Avoid caffeine (e.g., colas, coffee) when possible.  Caffeine can cause dehydration. </li></ul><br /><h2>PSYCHOLOGICAL</h2><ul> <li> Use relaxation techniques, such as meditation, as a way to relax. </li> <li> Listen to music. </li> <li> Describe how you feel in a daily log, journal, or diary.  Each day record your fatigue on a scale from 0-10 (0= no fatigue and 10= worst fatigue possible). </li></ul></p><a name=\"5\"></a><h1>How is anemia managed?</h1><p>There are two standard approaches to treating anemia in people with cancer. The treatment may vary depending on what type of cancer you have. <br /><br /><b>APPROACH #1</b><br />Cancer treatments can lower the level or erythropoietin (a hormone produced in the kidneys) in the blood.  Drugs, such as epoetin alfa (Epogen&#174;, Procrit&#174;) or darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp&#174;), are synthetic forms or erythropietin. Although injected into the body, they do not work instantly.  It may be several days to weeks before a patient notices a difference in their energy level.  Side effects are infrequent and mild. Some that are experienced include increased blood pressure, minor allergic response, edema, and diarrhea. (NOTE: These medications are not appropriate for use with all cancers.)<br /><br /><b>APPROACH #2</b><br />Blood transfusions are only appropriate for people who are very anemic, and whose cancer treatments can\'t be delayed while the anemia is being treated. Transfusions are the fastest way to improve red blood cell counts for people with severe anemia. </p><br /><a name=\"6\"></a><h1>What can family members and friends do to help me with my anemia?</h1><p>Ask family members and friends to:<ul> <li> Help with housework, chores, yard work, and cooking. </li> <li> Take a walk with you and encourage you to walk every day. </li> <li> Offer you fluids throughout the day. </li> <li> Help you set daily priorities so you avoid overexertion. </li></ul></p><a name=\"7\"></a><h1>How can I talk to family members and friends about my anemia?</h1><p>Here are some ideas that may help you talk to family members and friends:<ul> <li> Be open and honest about feelings with your family members. </li> <li> Ask your family members and friends how your fatigue is affecting them.  </li></ul></p><a name=\"8\"></a><h1>What should I report to my healthcare provider about my anemia?</h1><p>If you experience any of the following signs or symptoms, report them to your healthcare provider:<ul> <li> Increased fatigue. </li> <li> Shortness of breath. </li> <li> Unable to do any of your usual daily activities. </li> <li> Unable to get out of bed for more than 24 hours. </li> <li> Rapid heart beat. </li> <li> Pale skin. </li> <li> Unable to think clearly. </li> <li> Chest pain. </li> <li> Difficulty focusing on things, such as TV, talking, or reading. </li> <li> Signs of bleeding. </li> <li> Difficulty staying warm. </li> <li> Dizziness. </li> <li> Headache. </li></ul></p><a name=\"9\"></a><h1>What things should I discuss with my healthcare provider about my anemia?</h1><p>If you are experiencing anemia, you should discuss the following with your healthcare provider:<ul> <li> Should I use nutritional supplements to help my anemia? </li> <li> Will my anemia cause delays in my cancer treatment? </li> <li> What are the treatment options for my anemia? </li> <li> How long will it take for my anemia treatment to begin to work? </li> <li> If my health insurance does not pay for anemia treatment, what other options are available to me? </li> <li> Are there things that I can do to help my anemia? </li> <li> Ask your healthcare provider for your blood counts. </li></ul></p><a name=\"10\"></a><h1>Where can I get more information?</h1><p>For more information, contact the people or organizations at the numbers or websites listed below:<ul> <li> American Cancer Society: 1-800-ACS-2345 or <a href=http://www.cancer.org target=_blank>http://www.cancer.org</a> Click on patients, family & friends, then coping with treatment. </li> <li> National Cancer Institute: 1-800-4-CANCER or <a href=http://www.cancer.gov/cancerinfo/ target=_blank>http://www.cancer.gov/cancerinfo/</a> Click on coping with cancer. </li> <li> The Family Care Research Program: <a href=http://www.cancercare.msu.edu target=_blank>http://www.cancercare.msu.edu</a> </li> <li> Anemia: <a href=http://www.anemia.com target=_blank>http://www.anemia.com</a> Click on chemotherapy-related anemia. </li></ul></p><a name=\"11\"></a><h1>References</h1><p><ul> <li> Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (n.d.).

If not treated and managed, it can lead to a more serious condition. Increasing your appetite, you can improve both your quality of life and ability to tolerate cancer treatments. </p><br /><a name=\"2\"></a><h1>How do people describe lack of appetite?</h1><p>Lack of appetite can be described as not having the desire to eat.  Often, people with cancer or those undergoing cancer treatment report that they have no appetite, feel full quicker than usual, or both.</p><br /><a name=\"3\"></a><h1>What causes lack of appetite?</h1><p>Cancer itself can affect your appetite, food digestion, and energy level.  Many people report that their senses of taste and smell change because of their treatment. These changes can decrease appetite.  Some have experienced changes in appetite because of nausea, vomiting, or uncontrolled pain and fatigue.  Other factors that can contribute to appetite loss include medications, anxiety, depression or sadness, lack of sleep, difficulty swallowing, constipation, or diarrhea. </p><br /><a name=\"4\"></a><h1>What can I do about lack of appetite?</h1><p>Not eating well can keep you from getting the nutrients that you need.  Here are some tips you might find helpful:<br /><br /><h2>ACTIVITY</h2><ul> <li> Assess your nutritional status by keeping a log of the food that you eat.  Write down all of the food that you ate in a 24 hour period. </li> <li> Freeze food in meal size portions. </li> <li> Give food a chance.  Even though you have trouble eating now, you may find a time when eating is enjoyable. </li> <li> Weigh yourself at the same time every day. </li> <li> Stock up on favorite foods. </li> <li> Keep a supply of foods that can be eaten during times of illness, such as popsicles, broths, or lemon-lime soda. </li> <li> Do not eat your favorite foods on the day of your treatments or when you feel nauseated.  Your body may learn to associate these foods with nausea. </li> <li> Eat foods that are cold or room temperature if food odors bother you. </li> <li> Do not try to lose weight while being treated for cancer, unless directed by your healthcare provider to do so. </li> <li> Do light exercises for 30 minutes before mealtime may help you to feel hungrier.  Examples of light exercises are walking around the block or around the house. </li></ul><br /><h2>COMMUNICATION</h2><ul> <li> Ask your nurse, dietician, or doctor to help you assess your nutritional status before and during your treatment. </li></ul><br /><h2>DIET</h2><ul> <li> Try new foods.  Tastes can change.  Different foods may be a pleasant addition to your menu. </li> <li> Using sauces and gravies can make swallowing easier. </li> <li> Drink 8 (8oz.) glasses of water or other non-caffeinated drinks every day.  Avoid caffeine (i.e. colas, coffee) when possible.  Caffeine can cause dehydration. </li> <li> Eat calorie-rich foods such as malts, shakes, and omelets. </li> <li> Try eating 5-6 smaller meals or snacks throughout the day. </li> <li> Avoid carbonated beverages, they can make you feel full but do not add nutrition. </li> <li> Get approval from your oncologist to try Boost or Ensure. These high-calorie supplements can also be mixed with fruit or ice cream to make a shake.  Supplements can be filling, so try to eat your meal before taking them.  NOTE:  Supplements can stay on your tongue and mouth.  Many find it helpful to sip through a straw and drink them cold. </li> <li> Suck on hard candy if you have a metallic taste in your mouth. </li> <li> Eat meats, fruits and vegetables in small portions throughout the day.  Avoid milk if its upsets your stomach. </li> <li> Eat protein everyday (tuna fish, chicken, peanut butter, and cheese). </li><br /><ul> <li> Treat constipation and diarrhea.  Both of them can affect your appetite.</li> <li>Use seasonings on foods that you are finding unpleasant.  Basil, oregano and rosemary can make meat, fish or poultry more flavorful. </li></ul></ul><br /><h2>MEDICATION</h2><ul> <li> Take a daily vitamin supplement. </li> <li> Take your prescribed anti-nausea medications 30-60 minutes before eating. </li> <li> Ask your doctor if an appetite stimulant like Megace (a hormone that improves appetite and can help you increase your calorie intake) would be good for you. </li></ul><br /><h2>INFORMATION FOR CAREGIVERS</h2><ul> <li> Do not try to push your family member into eating or drinking. </li> <li> Provide encouragement and support without being overwhelming. </li> <li> Keep snacks and utensils within easy reach. </li> <li> Plan on small, frequent meals. </li> <li> Encourage fluids if your family member cannot eat. Many fluids are nutritious and contain calories. Your family member may not drink much at a time.  Even when sipped, juices and other fluids can be beneficial. </li> <li> Be prepared for changing tastes. They may changes day-to-day.  Favorite foods may not taste good some days. </li> <li> Have high-energy foods available. </li></ul></p><a name=\"5\"></a><h1>What can family members and friends do to help me with my lack of appetite?</h1><p>Ask family members and friends to:<ul> <li> Keep foods around that require little or no preparation time.

No regular bowel movement for 3 days is described as constipation. Constipation is common for persons taking opioids (any medicine containing opium) and other medications for their pain. Constipation also occurs for those who have inadequate fluid or fiber intake, who have consistently low levels of physical activity, or as a result of the cancer process, chemotherapy or other drug therapies.</p><br /><a name=\"2\"></a><h1>How do people describe constipation?</h1><p>Many people have described constipation as feeling an enlargement or bloating in the abdomen, or a sense of fullness in the rectal area. Others describe small amounts of stool \"leaking\", small frequent \"smears\" of stool, or rectal pain with a bowel movement. Constantly feeling the need to have a bowel movement, but unable to pass stool, is another way to describe how constipation feels.</p><br /><a name=\"3\"></a><h1>What causes constipation?</h1><p>The cause of constipation varies. Pain medication and chemotherapy drugs can cause constipation. Constipation can be caused from the cancer itself.  Other causes include stress, fever, changes in diet, not drinking enough fluids, or low levels of physical activity. Constipation is common for those who spend a lot of time in bed, are not eating well, or are experiencing weakness.<br /><br />Don\'t think that constipation isn\'t important, will go away by its self, or is not worth treating. If constipation is not treated it is both very painful and dangerous to your health, and can lead to serious complications.</p><br /><a name=\"4\"></a><h1>What can I do about constipation?</h1><p>Here are some tips you may find helpful:<br /><br /><h2>ACTIVITY</h2><ul> <li> Exercise every day, at least a 15-minute walk.  Perform mild exercise, such as walking. </li> <li> Establish a daily bathroom routine that includes privacy.  Use the toilet after mealtime. </li> <li> Have a quiet comfortable environment when having a bowel movement. </li> <li> Avoid straining or pushing hard with bowel movements. </li></ul><br /><h2>DIET</h2><ul> <li> Drink 8 (8oz.) glasses of water or other non-caffeinated drinks every day.  Avoid caffeine (e.g., colas, coffee) when possible.  Caffeine can cause dehydration. </li> <li> Add unprocessed bran or wheat germ to your diet.  Start with two teaspoons per day and gradually increase to two tablespoons per day. </li> <li> Eat foods high in fibers, such as raw vegetables, popcorn, raisin bran, beans, whole grain cereal, raisins, and prunes. </li> <li> Drink warm liquids, such as lemon water, prune juice, or herbal tea after mealtime. </li></ul><br /><h2>MEDICATIONS</h2><ul> <li> Do not use suppositories or enemas without talking to your healthcare provider. </li> <li> Ask your healthcare providers for a stool softener and/or laxative. </li> <li> Ask your doctor for a laxative if you take a narcotic for pain. Pain medications with narcotics often cause constipation. </li></ul><br /><h2>COMMUNICATION</h2><ul> <li> Let your doctor or nurse know if you have hemorrhoids or tears in the skin around the rectum. </li></ul></p><a name=\"5\"></a><h1>What can family and friends do to help me with my constipation?</h1><p>Ask family members and friends to:<ul> <li> Prepare foods high in fiber. </li> <li> Offer you fluids throughout the day. </li> <li> Exercise with you. </li> <li> Help keep a log or record of bowel movements, bloating, gas or abdominal pain.

Usually a dry, hacking cough occurs with a sore throat and it may be a sign of infection.<br /><br />A constant cough can tire a person more easily, making it difficult to do his/her usual activities.  (Activity can aggravate the coughing.) Some report that coughing makes it hard to talk, eat meal or sleep at night.</p><br /><a name=\"3\"></a><h1>What causes cough?</h1><p>There are different kinds of cough. People with cancer may experience cough due to a number of different problems including viruses, chronic lung disorders, fatigue, pneumonia, pain, infection, or anxiety.

It can happen in response to an event or is because of changes in your body chemistry.<br /><br />In fact, clinical depression occurs in about 25% of people with cancer.  It can cause great distress, impaired functioning, and decrease a person\'s ability to follow his/her treatment schedule. The good news is clinical depression is treatable.</p><br /><a name=\"2\"></a><h1>How do people describe depression?</h1><p>Depression can affect everything in a person\'s life.  People have described depression as the darkest time in their life.   It is common to not want to talk to friends and family.<br /><br />When depressed, people may have trouble experiencing pleasure.  Many report physical problems, such as crying spells, eating (too much or not enough), or sleeping (too much or too little).  Others have described feeling hopeless, helpless, or worthless.  Some even report feelings that they want to hurt themselves.  Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you begin to feel this way or call 911.</p><br /><a name=\"3\"></a><h1>What causes depression?</h1><p>Depression can occur in response to a specific event, such as a cancer diagnosis or a death to a loved one.  Depression can also be a result from medications, being tired, or from chemical changes in the brain. People can usually cope with short-term feelings of depression.

Stool is what is left after your digestive system (stomach, small intestine, and colon) absorbs nutrients and fluid from what you eat and drink. When fluid is not absorbed or if your digestive system produces extra fluid, stools will be loose and watery. Loose stools are larger than usual, and people with diarrhea may pass more than a quart of watery stool a day. Severe or untreated diarrhea can lead to dehydration, which means the body does not have enough fluid to function properly.<br /><br />If left untreated diarrhea may cause dizziness, fainting, weight loss, dry skin, and weakness. Replacing fluids is the primary treatment for diarrhea.</p><br /><a name=\"2\"></a><h1>How do people describe diarrhea?</h1><p>People who have diarrhea may also have abdominal pain with cramping, bloating, and nausea. It is often described as having an urgent need to have a bowel movement and an inability to control it. People usually use the terms \"loose\" and \"watery\" stools, and report the number of times they have to use the bathroom within a period of time.<br /><br />Diarrhea can be mild (3 stools per day) to severe (12 or more stools per day). As a result, skin irritation and soreness around the rectum can occur.</p><br /><a name=\"3\"></a><h1>What causes diarrhea?</h1><p>Diarrhea can be caused by chemotherapy or radiation treatments to the abdomen, pelvis, or rectum. Treatments for cancer can interfere with normal bowel function, increase bowel activity, or by irritate the lining of the bowel. Loose or watery stools can start shortly after receiving treatment or up to two weeks later.  Other common causes of diarrhea include: antibiotics, infections, reactions to foods, or laxatives taken to prevent constipation.</p><br /><a name=\"4\"></a><h1>What can I do about diarrhea?</h1><p>Here are some tips you may find helpful:<br /><br /><h2>ACTIVITY</h2><ul> <li> Keep track of the number of stools you have within a 24 hour-period.  Also, record any cramping or gas pains in a diary. </li> <li> Diarrhea can cause pain and soreness to the skin around the rectum.  Clean the area often with unscented baby oil or baby wipes.  The aloe in baby wipes can be very soothing.  Use the wipes instead of toilet paper to gently wipe the rectal area.  Take warm baths or sitz baths 3-4 times a day.  Sit in the warm water for about 10 minutes.  Use Desitin&#174; or A&D&#174; ointment on the skin after each bowel movement. </li></ul><br /><h2>COMMUNICATION</h2><ul> <li> Contact your doctor or nurse to prescribe something for your diarrhea if over-the counter-medications do not work. </li></ul><br /><h2>DIET</h2><ul> <li> Try eating smaller, more frequent meals or snacks. </li> <li> Try eating foods such as: bananas, rice or oats, applesauce, smooth peanut butter, graham crackers, dry toast, crackers, plain pasta, eggs, poultry or baked potatoes. </li> <li> Avoid eating food that is high in fiber, fatty, or spicy.  Try not to eat rich desserts.  Examples of foods that can increase bowels movements or gas include: beans, raw vegetables, corn, cauliflower, broccoli, and hot peppers. </li> <li> Do not drink alcoholic beverages. </li> <li> Follow a low fiber/ low roughage diet.  Do not eat wheat and bran. </li> <li> Drink 8 (8oz.) glasses of water or other non-caffeinated drinks every day.  Avoid caffeine (e.g., colas, coffee) when possible.  Caffeine can cause dehydration. </li> <li> Replace lost fluids with nonfat broth, soup, orange juice, Pedialyte&#174; or sports drinks like Gatorade&#174;. </li> <li> When having diarrhea, drink less fluid with your meals.  Drink more fluid between meals and avoid hot liquids. </li> <li> Avoid nuts and dried fruits. </li> <li> Avoid milk products (including ice cream and cheese) until diarrhea subsides. </li></ul><br /><h2>MEDICATIONS</h2><ul> <li> Talk to your doctor or nurse about taking over-the-counter medications, such as Imodium&#174; AD, Kaopectate&#174;, Pepto-Bismol&#174; or Maalox&#174; antidiarrheal caplets (loperamide). </li> <li> Talk to your doctor or nurse before using any creams or ointments if you are receiving radiation treatments to the abdomen, pelvis, or rectal area. </li></ul></p><a name=\"5\"></a><h1>What can family members and friends do to help me with my diarrhea?</h1><p>Ask family members and friends to:<ul> <li> Buy food that can help decrease diarrhea.  Food items are listed above. </li> <li> Remind you to take your over-the-counter medicines as directed by your healthcare provider. </li> <li> Prepare low fiber meals. </li> <li> Offer you fluids and broth throughout the day. </li> <li> Assist in locating restrooms when outside your normal environment. </li> <li> Help with keeping a log or record of your bowel movements and symptoms. This log or record will help your medical team better understand and treat your diarrhea. Try to log the number of stools, time of day, whether stools were formed or watery, any cramping you experienced, and your daily weight.  Also record if any medication was taken and fluid intake. </li></ul></p><a name=\"6\"></a><h1>How can I talk to my family members and friends about my diarrhea?</h1><p>Here are some ideas that may help you talk to family members and friends:<ul> <li> Request privacy to discuss your concerns. </li> <li> Try to describe how the diarrhea makes you feel and express your concerns. </li> <li> Tell them if you are having any symptoms listed below. </li></ul></p><a name=\"7\"></a><h1>What should I report to my healthcare provider about my diarrhea?</h1><p>If you experience any of the following symptoms, report them to your healthcare provider:<ul> <li> Skin around the rectum that is open, sore, or tender. </li> <li> Spike a fever of 100.4  (38.0 C) associated with diarrhea. </li> <li> Bloody or black tarry looking stools. </li> <li> Unable to eat or drink for more than 24 hours. </li> <li> Diarrhea that continues for more than 3 days. </li> <li> Being thirsty. </li> <li> Feeling tired or dizzy. </li> <li> Fainting. </li> <li> Weakness. </li> <li> Urinating less often than usual. </li> <li> Having dark yellow colored urine. </li> <li> Severe abdominal cramps or pain. </li> <li> Heart palpations (heart racing when you are at rest). </li> <li> Have your log or record available with the following information: </li><br /><ul> <li> Your normal bowel pattern.</li> <li>Color, consistency, and number of stools in the last 24 hours.</li> <li>How much food and fluid you have taken in the last 1-2 days.</li> <li>Medicines that you have taken in the last 2-3 days.</li> <li>Any history of past bowel problems.</li> <li>If you are being treated with radiation therapy to the pelvis, abdomen, or rectum.</li> <li>Weight loss.</ul></ul></p><a name=\"8\"></a><h1>What things should I discuss with my healthcare provider?</h1><p>If you are experiencing diarrhea, you should discuss the following with your healthcare provider at your next appointment:<ul> <li> Does my chemotherapy medication cause diarrhea?

Anxiety can happen to anyone. Persons with cancer who have had surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation may get anxious more easily than others. Anxiety and fear are common and normal feelings that patients have when coping with the diagnosis or treatment of cancer.</p><br /><a name=\"2\"></a><h1>How do people describe anxiety?</h1><p>People who have anxiety say they feel uneasy, tension, apprehensive, wary, and agitated. They have a feeling of restlessness, uncertainty, and are fearful or have a sense of dread or impending doom.<br /><br />People tremble, sweat, or have rapid breathing, rapid heart rate, or heart pounding in the chest.

Saliva lubricates and moistens the mouth.  It is essential for chewing, tasting, swallowing, and talking. The enzymes in saliva help the body to digest food and protect teeth from cavities.</p><br /><a name=\"2\"></a><h1>How do people describe dry mouth?</h1><p>Dry mouth is sometimes described as \"cotton mouth\".  Some people say that their tongue sticks to the inside of their cheek.  Burning and cracks in the tongue may occur.  Saliva may feel dry, thick and/or ropey.  A dry mouth can make it difficult to chew and swallow food.  Changes in taste may occur.  Speech may be altered.<br /><br />Dry mouth also increases your risk of infection and can cause dental cavities. Using tobacco products and drinking alcoholic beverages can make these symptoms worse.</p><br /><a name=\"3\"></a><h1>What causes dry mouth?</h1><p>Dry mouth can be troubling side effect that people being treated for cancer sometimes experience.  It can be cause by a number of factors such as:<ul> <li> Medications: chemotherapy, pain medications, diuretics (water-pills), medications for anxiety, depression and nausea. Over-the-counter allergy, cough, cold and flu medications can also cause a dry mouth. </li> <li> Radiation therapy can cause dry mouth after the salivary glands have been exposed to radiation. The salivary glands are responsible for producing saliva in the mouth.  After a period of time, the salivary glands may start to work again but they rarely return to normal function. Dry mouth caused by radiation to the salivary glands can be a life-long problem. If you are scheduled to undergo radiation of the head and neck should have a thorough mouth exam by your dentist prior radiation treatment. </li> <li> Conditions, such as dehydration or fungal infection of the mouth (candiasis), can cause dry mouth. </li> <li> Surgery to the salivary glands may cause dry mouth. </li></ul></p><a name=\"4\"></a><h1>What can I do about dry mouth?</h1><p>Treatment for dry mouth varies depending on the underlying cause, such as dehydration, infection or medications. Dry mouth caused by damage to the salivary gland may be a life-long problem and require patience to treat. There are a lot of treatments to relieve dry mouth symptoms.<br /><br />Here are some tips you may find helpful: <br /><br /><h2>ACTIVITY</h2><ul> <li> Rinse mouth with water frequently.  Do this every two hours while awake.  Adding salt or baking soda (1/2 to 1 teaspoon in 8 ounces of water) can help. </li> <li> Inspect your mouth daily for signs of infection (such as redness, swelling, and white or red patches). Tell your healthcare provider if you notice any of these signs. </li> <li> Clean dentures and /or bridge after eating.  Do not put your dentures in if you are experiencing any discomfort caused by dry mouth. </li> <li> Use a soft bristled toothbrush to clean teeth after each meal and at bedtime. </li> <li> Use cool air, vaporized, or humidifiers. </li></ul><br /><h2>COMMUNICATION</h2><ul> <li> Talk to your dentist about daily fluoride treatments if you are receiving radiation therapy. Fluoride treatments may help reduce the risk of tooth decay. </li></ul><br /><h2>DIET</h2><ul> <li> Suck on non-irritating hard candy like lemon drops or jolly ranchers (sugar-free is best) chewing gum may also help. </li> <li> Drink 8 (8oz.) glasses of water or other non-caffeinated drinks every day.  Avoid caffeine (i.e. colas, coffee) when possible.  Caffeine can cause dehydration.  This also helps to loosen mucous. </li> <li> Carry a water bottle with you and sip frequently during the day to help keep the might moist. </li> <li> Limit coffee, tea, and alcohol.  These contribute to dry mouth. </li> <li> Avoid dry, sticky foods such as peanut butter. </li> <li> Do not eat or drink spicy or acidic products, such as salsa or citrus juices. </li> <li> Add liquids to solid foods to make them more tolerable (gravies, melted butter, yogurt, or mayonnaise). </li> <li> Milk is high in protein but may produce thick saliva.  If this is true for you, try soy or rice milk. </li></ul><br /><h2>MEDICATIONS</h2><ul> <li> Avoid mouth rinse products that have glycerin or alcohol as they can cause drying. </li> <li> Use saliva substitutes, which are available in the drug store without a prescription.

It is a decreased ability to do physical and mental work, regardless of enough sleep. People have less energy to do the things that they normally do. Fatigue is one of the most common side effects of cancer treatment, regardless of whether the treatment is radiation, or chemotherapy. It is more severe and distressing than everyday fatigue. Fatigue that is caused by cancer treatments can exist beyond the end of treatment. </p><br /><a name=\"2\"></a><h1>How do people describe fatigue?</h1><p>Those who experience fatigue often report having no energy for usual daily activities. Some say that their arms and legs feel heavy.  Others describe fatigue as feeling tired, weak, exhausted, worn-out, slow, or unable to concentrate. Rest does not always relieve it. People sometimes have feelings of sadness, irritability, or frustration.  They may tire easily even after napping or getting a good night\'s sleep. </p><br /><a name=\"3\"></a><h1>What causes fatigue?</h1><p>Fatigue can result from cancer therapy, emotional stress, spending too much time in bed, or from not getting enough exercise.  It can be caused by anemia (low red blood cell count), infections, poor nutrition, and pain. <br /><br />It is very important that you discuss fatigue with your healthcare provider. Fatigue can affect your quality of life, mood, relationships, job performance, and can even interfere with your treatment. </p><br /><a name=\"4\"></a><h1>What can I do about fatigue?</h1><p>It may not be possible to prevent fatigue caused by cancer and its treatment. However, you can take steps to help manage this side effect. <br /><br />Here are some tips you might find helpful: <br /><br /><h2>ACTIVITY</h2><ul> <li> Take short naps (30-45 minutes) in the late morning or early afternoon. </li> <li> Avoid long periods of bed rest. </li> <li> Manage other side effects that can make fatigue worse such as pain, anemia, sleep problems, infections, and emotional stress. </li> <li> Exercise every day.  Talk to your healthcare provider about what exercises are right for you. </li> <li> Conserve your energy.  Plan your activities around times when you usually have the most energy. </li> <li> Set priorities for your activities. </li> <li> Delegate activities to other people that you do not need to do yourself. </li></ul><br /><h2>COMMUNICATION</h2><ul> <li> Ask your healthcare provider about: </li><br /><ul> <li> Massage and healing touch as a therapy for your fatigue.</li> <li>Getting a referral to a physical therapist for help developing an exercise plan.</li> <li>Seeing a nutritionist for recommendations on nutritional supplements.</li> <li>Educational information about fatigue.</ul></ul><br /><h2>DIET</h2><ul> <li> Eat a diet with fresh fruits and vegetables, and lean meat/fish/chicken, and milk products (as recommended by your healthcare provider).  You need to eat for energy and good nutrition. </li></ul><br /><h2>MEDICATION</h2><ul> <li> Ask your healthcare provider if psychostimulants or antidepressants are right for you. These medications are prescribed by doctors. They can improve your mood, energy levels, and outlook on life. </li></ul><br /><h2>PSYCHOLOGICAL</h2><ul> <li> Consider learning relaxation therapy, guided imagery and meditation. </li> <li> Join a support group. Support groups can provide suggestions and reassurance in a safe environment.  You can share similar concerns with other people experiencing fatigue. </li></ul></p><a name=\"5\"></a><h1>What can family members and friends do to help me with my fatigue?</h1><p>Ask family members and friends to:<ul> <li> Help you with housework, chores, yard work or cooking. </li> <li> Take a walk with you and encourage you to walk every day. </li> <li> Offer you fluids throughout the day to increase your fluid intake. </li> <li> Help you set daily priorities. </li></ul></p><a name=\"6\"></a><h1>How can I talk with family members and friends about my fatigue?</h1><p>Here are some ideas that may help you talk to family members and friends:<ul> <li> Be open and honest about your feelings.

It is defined as a single temperature rise above 100.9 F (38.3 C) or a temperature higher than 100.4 F (38.0 C) that lasts for more than an hour (or as set by your doctor\'s office). Fever is a very important warning sign of infection in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy. </p><br /><a name=\"2\"></a><h1>How do people describe fever?</h1><p>Symptoms of fever in the cancer patient can include: increased skin temperature, feeling weak, muscle aches and pains, sweating and chills, feeling confused or dizzy. Depending on how long you have a fever and where you are, it can become an emergency. Most people have a body temperature range of 98.0 F to 98.6 F by mouth.  Normal body temperatures can range from 97.0 to 99.6 F (and will be one degree higher if taken rectally).</p><br /><a name=\"3\"></a><h1>What causes fever?</h1><p>Bacteria and other organisms can enter the blood stream through many places in the body, such as the skin or mucous membranes lining the mouth and gastrointestinal tract. The immune system attacks bacteria in the blood and releases substances causing the brain to raise the body temperature. It is estimated that 30% of people with cancer are at risk of developing neutropenia (low white blood count) and will develop a fever sometime during the course of cancer treatment. The main causes of fever in the cancer patient are infection and tumor. Other causes include drugs, cancer treatment, blood transfusion reactions and autoimmune problems. Common locations for infection include the lungs, vagina, urinary system, and skin.<br /><br />Most biotherapy drugs, such as Interlukin-1 and Interferon, are associated with acute flu-like syndrome.   Symptoms associated with the syndrome include fever, chills, fatigue, headache and body aches. The administration of colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), also known as blood growth factors, is associated with fever. The most common CSFs are Filgrastim (Neupogen&#174;), Pegfilgrastim, (or Neulasta&#174;) and Sargramostim (Leukine&#174;). CSFs can be given along with chemotherapy to keep the white blood cell count (WBC) from going down to dangerous levels.</p><br /><a name=\"4\"></a><h1>What can I do about fever?</h1><p>Here are some tips you might find helpful: <br /><br /><h2>ACTIVITY</h2><ul> <li> Have an easy-to-read thermometer on hand. </li> <li> Check your temperature at least 4 times a day if you are not feeling well.  Do not take your temperature within 10-15 minutes of drinking hot beverages.  Keep a record of your temperature readings. </li> <li> Relieve the discomfort of fever and chills by taking a luck-warm sponge bath or shower. </li> <li> Wash your hands with antibacterial soap often and with extra care, especially after using the bathroom, blowing your nose, or handling raw meat, fruits or vegetables. </li> <li> Ask your healthcare provider how often you should take your temperature if you have a fever. </li> <li> Ask your healthcare provider when you should call the office or go to the emergency room. </li> <li> Avoid contact with crowds or large groups of people. </li> <li> Avoid people who you know are sick. </li> <li> Use air conditioning or a fan to make you feel more comfortable. </li> <li> Try an ice pack wrapped in a towel or washcloth to the body, such as the forehead or under the arms. </li> <li> Get enough rest. </li> <li> Cover yourself with a blanket if you are chilly or a single sheet if you are hot. </li></ul><br /><h2>COMMUNICATION</h2><ul> <li> Ask your doctor or nurse how often you should be taking your temperature if you have a fever. </li> <li> Ask your doctor or nurse when you should call the office or go to the emergency room. </li></ul><br /><h2>DIET</h2><ul> <li> Eat and drink products that are high in protein and calories, such as peanut butter, Vitamin D milk products, and Carnation&#174; Instant Breakfast&#174.

During chemotherapy hair follicles are damaged.  The follicles produce weak and brittle hair that breaks off at the scalp. This is a common side effect of cancer treatments.</p><br /><a name=\"2\"></a><h1>How do people describe hair loss?</h1><p>Each person experiences hair loss differently.  Many people describe a tingling or aching sensation at their scalp just before hair begins to fall out.  Others repot that their hair started to thin before it fell out.  Hair loss typically occurs while being washed or brushed and can fall off on your pillow.  It can come out in clumps, or a few strands at a time. If complete hair loss is expected, it is usually complete within 3-7 days after the hair started to fall out. </p><br /><a name=\"3\"></a><h1>What causes hair loss?</h1><p>Chemotherapy attacks rapidly growing cells in the body such as cancer cells. It can also affect normal cells that grow rapidly, like our hair follicles. Many chemotherapy treatments have no affect on your hair. Others can cause mild hair thinning to complete hair loss. Your healthcare provider should tell you if hair loss is expected with your treatment and when to expect it. Scalp hair is most commonly affected. However, it is possible to lose other kinds of body hair, such as eyelashes, eyebrows, facial, and pubic hair.<br /><br />Most people begin to experience hair loss around 2 weeks after their first treatment. However, some people may not lose their hair until after the second treatment. Right now, there is no effective strategy to prevent or minimize hair loss. Hair loss is generally temporary and should begin to regrow when treatment is finished. Some people experience a small regrowth during treatment. Most experience a significant regrowth 3 months after treatment is completed. It is common for the regrowth to come in as different color and texture.</p><br /><a name=\"4\"></a><h1>What can I do about hair loss?</h1><p>Here are some tips you might find helpful: <br /><br /><h2>ACTIVITY</h2><ul> <li> Use a soft bristled hairbrush and a gentle, pH-balanced shampoo. </li> <li> Choose a wig before you lose your hair.  Try it on and see how it suits you.  Your local American Cancer Society can direct you to specialty wig stores.  Most phone books list these in yellow pages as well. </li> <li> Consider wearing a scarf, turban, or hat to conceal hair loss.  These may be cooler and more comfortable than wigs. </li> <li> Use sunscreen on your scalp and wear a wide-brimmed hat to protect from sunburn.  Your scalp will be very sensitive to the sunburn. </li> <li> Sleep on a satin pillowcase to decrease friction. </li> <li> Avoid excessive brushing, combing, and washing your hair. </li> <li> Cut your hair to a manageable length before treatment begins.  (Shorter styles may help.) </li> <li> Avoid bleaching or coloring your hair. </li> <li> Have your stylist save several strands of hair from a haircut.  This will help you to match a wig to your normal hair color. </li> <li> Do not get a perm or color treatments, such as all-over color, highlights, or lowlights. </li> <li> Avoid extreme temperatures that may bother your scalp. </li> <li> Air-dry your hair.  If possible, do not use a hair dryer. </li> <li> Avoid using curling irons, curlers, or flat irons. </li></ul><br /><h2>COMMUNICATION</h2><ul> <li> Contact your insurance company to see if they will cover all or part of a wig (hair prosthesis).  Many insurance companies do cover (some or all of) the cost if it is prescribed by a physician as part of cancer treatment.  Medicare will not pay for wigs.  If you must pay for your own wig, save the receipt.  For tax purposes, it can be used as a medical deduction. </li> <li> Contact the Look Good...Feel Better program through the American Cancer Society.  It is an excellent way to learn how to put on scarves, turbans, and other head coverings in a way that suits you. </li></ul><br /><h2>MEDICATION</h2><ul> <li> Lubricate your scalp with baby oil, A&D ointment, or mineral oil.  This may help minimize drying and flaking after hair loss is complete. </li></ul></p><a name=\"5\"></a><h1>How can family members and friends help me with my hair loss (alopecia)?</h1><p>Ask a family member or friend to: <ul> <li> Go with you to a wig shop or hair appointment for support. </li> <li> Listen to you and be there for you. Losing your hair can be devastating and a constant reminder of your cancer when you look in the mirror. </li> <li> Remind you to contact the insurance company to see if they will pay for the wig as a hair prosthesis. </li></ul></p><a name=\"6\"></a><h1>How can I talk to family members and friends about my hair loss?</h1><p>Here are some ideas that may help you talk to family members and friends:<ul> <li> Talk with your family members and friends about your feelings. </li> <li> Tell family and friends how your hair loss is affecting you.  It is normal to be upset and may affect how you feel about yourself. It is a stressful event for most patients. </li></ul></p><a name=\"7\"></a><h1>What should I report to my healthcare provider about my hair loss?</h1><p>If you experience any of the following symptoms, report them to your healthcare provider:<ul> <li> Lesions or sores on the scalp. </li> <li> Any of the following feelings after losing your hair: </li><br /><ul> <li> Unable to enjoy normal social or leisure activities.</li> <li>Social isolation.</li> <li>Withdrawal from family and friends.</li> <li>Loss of libido (sex drive).</li> <li>Feeling of being unattractive.</li> <li>Depression or sadness lasting more than 2 weeks.</ul></ul></p><a name=\"8\"></a><h1>What things should I discuss with my healthcare provider about my hair loss?</h1><p>If you are experiencing hair loss, you should discuss the following with your healthcare provider at your next appointment:<ul> <li> Will my chemotherapy or radiation cause me to lose some or all of my hair? </li> <li> When is my hair likely to start to fall out? </li> <li> If my hair doesn\'t fall out from my treatment does that mean the chemotherapy is not working? </li> <li> Can you provide me with information on managing the hair loss process and arranging for head coverings? Where can I go for help? </li> <li> Please provide me with a prescription for \"hair prosthesis\" (wig), for my insurance company.  Insurance companies are more likely to cover a wig if it is written as a \"hair prosthesis.\" </li> <li> If financial circumstances make it difficult for me to purchase a wig, where can I get help paying for one? </li> <li> How long after chemotherapy ends will it be before my hair grows back? </li></ul></p><a name=\"9\"></a><h1>Where can I get more information?</h1><p>For more information, contact the people or organizations at the numbers or websites listed below:<ul> <li> Contact your healthcare providers.

Sometimes the hands and feet become so painful that it may be difficult to hold objects in your hands, wear shoes, and even walk without discomfort. It is very important that all of these symptoms are reported to your doctor or nurse immediately. Early reporting of hand-foot syndrome is the best way to decrease the severity and prevent further complications.</p><br /><a name=\"2\"></a><h1>How do people describe hand-foot syndrome?</h1><p>Most of the time, the earliest symptoms of hand-foot syndrome are tingling and numbness with slight redness. Tingling and redness in the hands and/or feet can occur at any time while on chemotherapy. It can be expected with some drugs, too.  Do not stop taking medication unless you receive other instructions from your doctor.  Tell your healthcare provider know that you are experiencing these symptoms. If the redness continues, the hands and/or feet become red and swollen, or you have any discomfort contact your healthcare provider immediately.<br /><br />Other more severe symptoms described are dryness, cracking, flaking, and small blisters or sores on the palms of the hands and/or soles of the feet. Hand-foot syndrome can be uncomfortable and interfere with your ability to do normal daily activities.</p><br /><a name=\"3\"></a><h1>What causes hand-foot syndrome?</h1><p>The exact cause of hand/foot syndrome is unknown. One theory is that the chemotherapy builds up in the sweat glands in the hands and feet. Heat or friction on the palms and soles increase the amount of the chemotherapy drug in the capillaries, which can leak out into the tissue. This leakage of drug results in the redness, tenderness, peeling, and discomfort in the hands and/or feet. The chemotherapy drugs most commonly reported to cause hand-foot syndrome include: <ul> <li> Capecitabine (Xeloda&#174;) </li> <li> Fluorouracil (5-FU) continuous infusion </li> <li> Liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil&#174;) </li> <li> Idarubicin (Idamycin&#174;) </li> <li> Floxuridine (fudr&#174;) </li> <li> Continuous infusion of doxorubicin </li> <li> Sunitinib (Sutent&#174;) </li> <li> Sorafenib (Nexavar&#174;) </li></ul></p><a name=\"4\"></a><h1>What can I do about hand-foot syndrome?</h1><p>Prevention is very important in trying to reduce the development of hand-foot syndrome. Management involves modifying some of your normal activities to reduce friction and heat exposure to your hands and feet for a period of time following treatment.  This period is about one week after receiving the IV medication and as long as possible while you are taking oral (by mouth) medications, such as Capcitabine or continuous infusion of 5-FU.<br /><br />Here are some tips you might find helpful:<br /><br /><h2>ACTIVITY</h2><ul> <li> Avoid long exposure of hands and feet to hot water.  Examples of hot water exposures include washing dishes, long showers, or tub baths. </li> <li> Take short, cool water showers to reduce the drug exposure to the soles of your feet. </li> <li> Do not wear rubber gloves to wash dishes or clean.  The rubber will hold heat against your palms. </li> <li> Avoid activities that cause unnecessary force or friction on the feet, such as jogging, aerobics, and long walks or standing for long periods of time. </li> <li> Avoid contact with harsh chemicals used in laundry detergents or household cleaning products. </li> <li> Avoid using garden tools, household tools (such as screwdrivers), and other tasks that require squeezing your hand on a hard surface. </li> <li> Do not use knives to chop food. It may cause excessive pressure and friction on your palms. </li> <li> Cool your hands and feet with ice packs or cool compresses for 15-20 minutes at a time.  Do not apply ice directly to the skin. </li> <li> Elevate your hands and feet to avoid swelling when sitting or lying down. </li> <li> Pat skin carefully to dry.  Try not to rub your skin with a towel. </li> <li> Apply mild skin care lotion to keep your hands and feet moist.  Do not rub or massage lotion into your hands or feet.  Rubbing or massaging can create friction. </li> <li> Avoid sunny windows, or sitting in the sun and wear sunscreen on all exposed skin when you go outside. </li> <li> Wear loose, well-ventilated shoes and clothes. </li> <li> Try gel inserts in your shoes. </li> <li> Wear cotton socks. </li> <li> Immerse hands and feet in cool water 3-4 times a day. </li> <li> Avoid wearing rings. </li> <li> Check your skin for signs of infections. Look for any drainage, odor, or increased redness. If you have an infection, you may also have a fever.  If you notice any of these signs contact your healthcare provider. </li></ul><br /><h2>COMMUNICATION</h2><ul> <li> Report any change in your daily activities to your healthcare provider. </li></ul><br /><h2>DIET</h2><ul> <li> Drink 8 (8oz.) glasses of water or other non-caffeinated drinks every day.  Avoid caffeine (i.e. colas, coffee) when possible.  Caffeine can cause dehydration. </li></ul><br /><h2>MEDICATION</h2><ul> <li> Over-the-counter drugs, such as Tylenol&#174; or ibuprofen&#174;, may be helpful to relieve discomfort associated with hand-food syndrome. Check with your doctor before taking any pain medication. </li> <li> Corticosteroids may be ordered from your doctor to help reduce swelling and redness. </li> <li> Taking Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) may be beneficial in preventing and treating hand-foot syndrome and should be discussed with your doctor. </li> <li> Emollients such as Aveeno&#174;, Lubriderm&#174;, Udder Cream&#174;, Bag Balm&#174;, and Aquaphor&#174; provide excellent moisturizing to our hands and feet. </li> <li> Avoid topical anesthetics or diphenhydramine-containing creams.  These can make the toxicity of the skin worse. </li></ul></p><a name=\"5\"></a><h1>How is hand-foot syndrome managed?</h1><p>Severe cases of hand-foot syndrome are first treated by reducing or temporarily stopping the chemotherapy drug that is causing it. Other approaches that your healthcare provider may suggest include: <ul> <li> Over-the-counter Tylenol&#174; or ibuprofen&#174; may help to relieve the discomfort associated with hand-foot syndrome. Check with your healthcare provider before taking any pain medication. </li> <li> Corticosteriods may be ordered by your healthcare provider to help reduce swelling and redness. </li> <li> Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine) may be beneficial in preventing and treating hand-foot syndrome. Discuss this option with your healthcare provider before taking it. </li></ul></p><a name=\"6\"></a><h1>What can family members and friends do to help me with my hand-foot syndrome?</h1><p>Ask family members and friends to:<ul> <li> Prepare meals for you. </li> <li> Help with daily household chores such as gardening or dishwashing. </li> <li> Test water temperatures before bathing or washing dishes.  Inexpensive thermometers are sold in stores that can check water temperatures.  This may be an option for you and your family. </li> <li> Help gently apply lotions to hands and feet. </li> <li> Help with your daily activities, such as bathing, and driving. </li></ul></p><a name=\"7\"></a><h1>How can I talk to my family members and friends about my hand-foot syndrome?</h1><p>Here are some ideas that may help you talk to family members and friends:<ul> <li> Ask family members and friends how the hand-foot syndrome is affecting them. </li> <li> Talk to family and friends how the hand-foot syndrome is affecting your emotions and mood. </li> <li> Talk to family and friends how the hand-foot syndrome is interfering with your life and ability to function. </li> <li> Ask family members for suggestions to help you function as close to normal as possible. </li></ul></p><a name=\"8\"></a><h1>What should I report to my healthcare provider?</h1><p>If you experience any of the following symptoms, report them to your healthcare provider:<ul> <li> Redness, swelling, tingling, or pain in the hands and/or feet. Discuss any symptoms with your healthcare provider immediately.  Do not stop your medication until you have talked to your healthcare provider. </li> <li> Any temperature rise above 100.9 F (38.3 C), or a temperature higher than 100.4 F (38.0 C) that lasts for more than an hour, or as set by your doctor\'s office. </li> <li> An increase of 4 stools over normal bowel pattern in a 24 hour period or diarrhea during the night. </li> <li> Tenderness, redness, or sores in the mouth. </li> <li> Vomiting. </li> <li> Unable to keep down any fluids for 24 hours. </li></ul></p><a name=\"9\"></a><h1>What things should I discuss with my healthcare provider?</h1><p>If you are experiencing hand and foot syndrome, you should discuss the following with your healthcare provider at your next appointment:<ul> <li> Will my chemotherapy put me at risk for developing hand-foot syndrome? </li> <li> Are there things you can give me if my hands and/or feet become painful? </li> <li> Will I be able to continue to work? </li> <li> If I do all of the things suggested could hand-foot syndrome be prevented? </li> <li> What symptoms do you want me to call you for? </li></ul></p><a name=\"10\"></a><h1>Where can I get more information?</h1><p>For more information, contact the people or organizations at the numbers or websites listed below:<ul> <li> Contact your healthcare provider. </li> <li> Caring 4 Cancer: <a href=http://cancer.caring4health.com/default.aspx target=_blank>http://cancer.caring4health.com/default.aspx</a> Click on managing side effects (in the center of the page), then click on less common side effects (In the right hand column), and finally on hand-foot syndrome (located in the right hand column). </li> <li> Chemocare: <a href=http://chemocare.com target=_blank>http://chemocare.com</a> Click on managing side effects and then hand-foot syndrome. </li> <li>  American Cancer Society: 1-800-ACS-2345 or <a href=http://www.cancer.org target=_blank>http://www.cancer.org</a> </li> <li> Family Care Research Program: <a href=http://cancercare.msu.edu/ target=_blank>http://cancercare.msu.edu/</a> </li> <li> National Cancer Institute: 1-800-4-CANCER or <a href=http://www.cancer.gov/cancerinfo target=_blank>http://www.cancer.gov/cancerinfo</a> Click on coping with cancer. </li></ul></p><a name=\"11\"></a><h1>References</h1><p><ul> <li> Backes, W.

Open sores called ulcers can develop. About half of cancer patients on chemotherapy and almost all who have radiation to the head or neck will experience mouth discomfort as a side effect of treatment.<br /><br />The discomfort can range from mild to severe. Mild discomfort is a change in the way the mouth feels. It is easily treated and quick to heal. Moderate discomfort is considered to be redness and open sores in the mouth. Severe mucositis involves many sores in the mouth, bleeding, and severe pain. None of these discomfort levels are pleasant. Each can cause other problems including difficulty swallowing, talking, eating, and infection. There are preventive steps and treatment that you can do to minimize this uncomfortable side effect. <br /><br />It is very important that any discomfort in your mouth is reported to your doctor or nurse immediately. Early reporting is the best way to decrease the severity and prevent further complications. Mucositis can delay your cancer treatment or limit the dose of your therapy.</p><br /><a name=\"2\"></a><h1>How do people describe mouth sores?</h1><p>After about three to five days of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, the lining of the mouth may feel a little warm. There may be some tingling or minor soreness. Within one to two weeks of starting your treatment, sores may begin to appear. A week or two after your treatment is finished the sores begin to heal.  Usually after the third week out of treatment, the ulcers and pain will have disappeared. <br /><br />There are a number of warning signs that commonly describe mucositis, including:<ul> <li> Burning or tingling feeling inside the mouth. </li> <li> Inside of the mouth looks red, shiny, and swollen. </li> <li> Red, inflamed patches. These may include white spots. </li> <li> Raw feeling in the throat. </li> <li> Unusual mouth dryness. </li> <li> Open sores or ulcers in the mouth or under the tongue. </li> <li> Thick secretions or saliva. </li> <li> Blood in the mouth or saliva. </li> <li> Pain in the mouth. </li></ul></p><a name=\"3\"></a><h1>What causes mouth sores?</h1><p>Chemotherapy and radiation therapy work on rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells.  They also attack other cells in the body, including those forming the lining of the mouth and throat. As mouth cells die from the treatment, open sores can develop.  Gradually, normal cells in the mouth start to grow again and the sores heal. <br /><br />Individual risk factors for developing mouth sores include: <ul> <li> Advanced age. </li> <li> Poor nutritional status. </li> <li> Poor oral hygiene. </li> <li> Poor fitting dentures. </li> <li> Tobacco use (cigarettes, cigars, or pipes). </li> <li> Drink alcohol beverages (beer, wine, or liquor). </li></ul><p>Treatment related risk factors include:<ul> <li> Drug dosage. </li> <li> Treatment schedule. </li> <li> Receiving radiation therapy. </li></ul><p>A large number of chemotherapy drugs can cause mouth sores. It is most commonly reported with:<ul> <li> 5- fluoroucil (5-FU) </li> <li> Cisplatin&#174; </li> <li> Etoposide&#174; </li> <li> Methotrexate&#174; </li> <li> Cytarabine&#174; </li> <li> Bleomycin&#174; </li> <li> Cyclophosphamide&#174; </li> <li> Dactinomycin&#174; </li> <li> Paclitaxel&#174; </li> <li> High doses of chemotherapy </li></ul></p><a name=\"4\"></a><h1>What can I do about mouth sores?</h1><p>Proper mouth care on a frequent, daily basis plays an important role in oral health during cancer therapy. You may not be able to prevent all problems, but it will decrease the severity of the problems, especially with certain chemotherapy treatments and/or radiation therapy.<br /><br /><h2>ACTIVITY</h2><ul> <li> Schedule a complete dental examination before you begin your chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment.  Inform your dentist that you will be undergoing cancer treatment. </li> <li> Take care of your mouth and keep it clean.  That means careful brushing and flossing based on discussion with your doctor and/or dentist. </li> <li> Use the softest bristle brush available or an oral sponge.  (Rinsing the bristles in hot water can even make them softer). </li> <li> Brush your teeth after every meal and at bedtime using nonabrasive toothpaste with no strong whiteners, which may cause irritation. Brush all tooth surfaces for at least 90 seconds. </li> <li> Brush your tongue as well as teeth and gums to help reduce the risk of fungal infections. </li> <li> Change your toothbrush frequently --every week or so. </li> <li> Do not use special appliances, such as water piks and electric toothbrushes. They may further irritate sensitive mouth tissue and gums. </li> <li> Floss gently everyday with unwaxed dental floss.  Stop flossing if you experience any bleeding or low blood counts. </li> <li> Clean dentures after every meal.  If possible, avoid wearing dentures overnight while asleep. </li> <li> Make sure your dentures fit properly. Repair or replace them if they do not fit well.  Poor fitting dentures can rub and cause additional pain in a tender mouth. </li> <li> Avoid using mouth rinse products that have glycerin or alcohol as they can cause dying in your mouth. </li> <li> Rinse mouth frequently (every 2 hours while awake & when awake during the night).  Mouth solution: </li><br /><ul> <li> 1/2 teaspoon salt</li> <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li> <li>4 cups (1 quart) of plain water</li> <li>Shake or stir the solution.  Keep it with you for regular use.  If you make more than a one-day supply, keep the remainder in the refrigerator.</ul></ul><br /><h2>COMMUNICATION</h2><ul> <li> Check with your healthcare provider to make sure it is safe to wear your dentures if you are receiving radiation treatments to the head and neck area. </li> <li> Talk to your healthcare provider if you need additional suggestions or continue to lose weight during your treatment.  Many practices have dieticians available for advice. </li> <li> Ask your doctor if you can take Tylenol&#174; or ibuprofen&#174; for pain relief. </li> <li> Ask your healthcare provider if there is a specific medication that can help fight infections.  Chemotherapy and radiation can weaken the immune system.  Bacteria that live in the mouth can cause infections in mouth sores. </li></ul><br /><h2>DIET</h2><ul> <li> Drink at least 8-10 glasses of non-carbonated liquids each day. </li> <li> Suck on non-irritating hard candy (sugar-free is best). Chewing gum may help. </li> <li> Eat popsicles or suck ice cubes for moisture. </li> <li> Avoid very hot food.  If your mouth is tender, try eating most of your food warm or at room temperature. </li> <li> Avoid highly seasoned food, which can aggravate mouth soreness. </li> <li> Avoid alcohol and tobacco.  Both irritate an already-sore mouth and throat. </li> <li> Restrict the amount of citrus fruit, tomatoes, and salty food in your diet. They can be uncomfortable for some people with mouth sores. </li> <li> Grind up or puree food in a blender. Foods with shape edges, such as chips and cracker, may be irritating. </li> <li> Use sauces or gravies to make foods easier for you to swallow and chew. </li> <li> Small, frequent meals may also be easier for you to eat. </li> <li> Drink liquid supplements to maintain your calorie intake. Examples of supplements are  Carnation&#174; Instant Breakfast&#174;, Ensure&#174;, and Boost&#174;. </li> <li> Choose to eat soft and soothing foods. Examples include: ice cream, milkshakes, baby foods, mashed potatoes, scrambled eggs, cottage cheese, custards, puddings, and gelatin. </li></ul><br /><h2>MEDICATION</h2><ul> <li> Try artificial saliva, such as Oral Balance&#174;, Moist Plus&#174;, and Salivant&#174;. This can be purchased at a drugstore without a prescription. </li> <li> Keep your lips moist with lip balm, Chapstick&#174;, or petroleum jelly. </li> <li> Use a water-based mouth moisturizer to help keep the mouth moist. An example of a moisturizer is Biotene&#174; Oral Lubricant.) </li> <li> Do not use liquid medications containing alcohol, such as cough medications. They may irritate the mouth. </li> <li> Take stronger drugs for severe pain. Pain causes stress, depression, and fatigue. Opiates are a class of strong drugs, one of which is morphine, that provide effective pain relief. It is very important to talk to your doctor or nurse if your pain is not being controlled. Many opiates are also available in liquids and patches if you are not able to swallow pills. </li> <li> Treat discomfort/pain: </li><br /><ul> <li> Use topical or local agents such as Orajel&#174;, Anbesol&#174;, Zilactin-b&#174;, or Orabase&#174;, which are available in the drugstore.</li> <li>A combination mouthwash with a local anesthetic can be prescribed from your healthcare provider. Take 2 teaspoons every 2-4 hours or prior to meals to alleviate mild discomfort.</li> <li>Gelclair&#174; is a prescription medication available to sooth the oral pain from sores.</li> <li>Ask your doctor if you can take Tylenol&#174; or ibuprofen&#174; for pain relief.<br /><br/></ul> <li> Severe pain: </li><br /><ul> <li> Do not resist taking stronger drugs for severe pain. Pain causes stress, depression, and fatigue. Opiates&#174;, a class of drug that includes morphine, are used for pain relief. It is very important to talk to your healthcare provider if your pain is not being controlled. Many opiates are also available in liquids and patches if you are not able to swallow pills.<br/><br/></ul> <li> Fight infections: </li><ul> <li> Chemotherapy and radiation can weaken the immune system.

Feeling nauseous can be worse than vomiting. Nausea and vomiting that does not go away can cause dehydration (loss of fluids), loss of appetite, imbalance of vitamin and minerals, weakness, difficulty concentrating and poor quality of life. <br /><br />Two of the side effects that people find most concerning while undergoing cancer treatment are nausea and vomiting. Controlling these side effects is a very important part of your treatment. There are many medications and therapies that can effectively control nausea and vomiting.  Report your symptoms to your healthcare provider so that the right treatment can be found for you.</p><br /><a name=\"2\"></a><h1>How do people describe nausea?</h1><p>People describe nausea as an unpleasant feeling related to food, smells or situations, such as cancer treatment. With this feeling, there may be a biter (or acidic) taste in the mouth or abdominal fullness while eating.  Some people who feel nauseous describe it as, \"sick to my stomach\", \"queasy\", or \"butterflies\". Nausea may cause increased saliva, lightheadedness, dizziness, difficulty swallowing, skin temperature changes, fast heart rate and lack of appetite. </p><br /><a name=\"3\"></a><h1>What causes nausea?</h1><p>Nausea is caused when certain parts of the intestinal tract or specific areas of the brain become stimulated.  Chemotherapy and radiation treatments can cause a person with cancer to have nausea and vomiting.</p><h4>Chemotherapy</h4><p>All chemotherapies are different. Some can cause more nausea and vomiting than others. There are different types of chemotherapy related nausea and vomiting: <ul> <li> Acute- occurs a few minutes to hours after chemotherapy is given and goes away within the first 24 hours. </li> <li> Delayed- develops more than 24 hours after the chemotherapy is given and can last 6-7 days. </li> <li> Anticipatory- learned from previous experiences with vomiting. It occurs as a result of an unpleasant experience with chemotherapy. </li> <li> Breakthrough- occurs despite treatment to prevent it. </li> <li> Refractory- occurs after a few chemotherapy treatments even though the person is being treated for nausea. </li></ul><h4>Radiation</h4><p>The chance of nausea and vomiting is greater when the area being radiated is the brain or the abdomen, specifically the small intestine (or small bowel). The symptoms can occur 1-2 hours after treatment and can last for several hours. <br /><br />Other causes of nausea are:<ul> <li> The cancer itself can cause nausea and vomiting, especially with gastrointestinal tumors and brain cancer. </li> <li> Use of pain medications (narcotics) and antidepressants. </li> <li> Constipation and bowel obstruction. </li> <li> Anxiety. </li> <li> Taste changes and smells. </li></ul></p><a name=\"4\"></a><h1>What can I do about nausea?</h1><p>Nausea is different for every person who experiences this symptom. The key is to prevent nausea from occurring. A variety of medications and behavioral therapies can be used to manage nausea. <br /><br />Here are some tips you might find helpful:<br /><br /><h2>ACTIVITY</h2><ul> <li> Get plenty of rest. </li> <li> Decrease unnecessary motion. </li> <li> Wear loose fitting clothes, be comfortable. </li> <li> Have fresh air with a fan or window open. </li> <li> Brush your teeth after meals. </li> <li> Use mouthwashes that do not contain alcohol to improve the taste in your mouth. </li></ul><br /><h2>DIET</h2><ul> <li> Avoid large meals. Try to eat several, small frequent meals to help maintain calories without overfilling the stomach. </li> <li> Eat slowly. </li> <li> Sip fluids slowly, such as ginger ale or ginger tea no sooner than 2 hours after the last vomiting episode. </li> <li> Try cool or cold foods, if hot food is unappealing.  Some suggestions include Jell-O, cottage or ricotta cheese, yogurt, pudding, sherbet, cold sandwiches, pasta or potato salads, and popsicles. </li> <li> Try eating dry foods, such as crackers, bagels, and toast. </li> <li> Bland foods work well from many people: try toast, cereals, yogurt, ices, cookies, pretzels and skinless cooked chicken. </li> <li> Avoid sweet, fried, or fatty foods. </li> <li> Avoid gas-producing vegetables, like broccoli, cauliflower, cucumbers, green peppers, brussel sprouts, and sauerkraut. </li> <li> Avoid acidic foods such as salsa, tomatoes, citrus fruits and citrus fruit juices, or vinegar. </li> <li> Chew gum or suck on hard candy. </li> <li> Try eating most foods during the time of when you are able to eat better.  Many people find that breakfast time is best. </li> <li> Avoid alcoholic beverages. </li> <li> Avoid your favorite foods if you are nauseated.  You may start to associate your favorite foods with feeling sick if you eat them while nauseated. </li> <li> Do not force yourself to eat. </li> <li> Avoid food aromas and other strong odors. </li></ul><br /><h2>MEDICATION</h2><ul> <li> Treat heartburn and gas with antacids. </li> <li> Learn your schedule for taking your anti-nausea medications and stay on it.  Do not decide to stop the medicine if you are feeling well.  Nausea can come back. </li></ul><br /><h2>PSYCHOLOGICAL</h2><ul> <li> Try using television or music as a distraction. </li> <li> Try behavioral therapies and techniques that can be helpful in treating nausea and vomiting include: </li><br /><ul> <li> Acupuncture.</li> <li>Acupressure.</li> <li>Guided imagery.</li> <li>Music therapy.</li> <li>Muscle relaxation.</li> <li>Counseling, support, and structured educational interventions.</ul></ul></p><a name=\"5\"></a><h1>What can family members and friends do to help with my nausea?</h1><p>Ask family members and friends to: <ul> <li> Not smoke or wear heavy perfume around you.

WBC defends the body against infection.  Neutrophils make up a large part of the total WBC count, and protect against most types of bacterial infections.  People who have neutropenia are at risk of infection.  Their bodies do not have the normal number of white blood cells needed to fight off infection.</p><br /><a name=\"2\"></a><h1>How do people describe neutropenia?</h1><p>Neutropenia will not necessarily cause you to become sick. You may not have any symptoms. Watch for signs of infection.<br /><br />There are several types of WBC.  Each plays an important role in the body\'s defense system.  Ask your healthcare provider when you are most likely to have low blood counts so that you can take extra precautions.</p><br /><a name=\"3\"></a><h1>What causes neutropenia?</h1><p>People undergoing cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy, are at greater risk for infection. Chemotherapy is the most common cause of a weakened immune system. Radiation therapy can damage the skin and lining layers, making them unable to keep infection out of your body.<br /><br />Cancer treatments, such as radiation and chemotherapy, destroy the most rapidly dividing cells in the body, which includes cancer cells as well as healthy cells, such as red blood cells and white blood cells.<br /><br />The time when your WBC will be at its lowest depends on the type and dose of chemotherapy that you are receiving.  People receiving chemotherapy every 21 days, they tend to experience low blood counts 10 to 14 days after a treatment. It is important to take precautions against infection during this time. Ask your healthcare provider when you will most likely have low counts.</p><br /><a name=\"4\"></a><h1>What happens to people when they have neutropenia?</h1><p>An infection occurs when bacteria or viruses grow, causing illness. The body has a normal defense system against infection that includes: skin, gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) lining, blood cells, and the immune system. When the WBC is low some people with neutropenia may have a fever, chills or sweating.  These symptoms can indicate your body is trying to fight off an infection. It becomes much more difficult for the body to help fight infection without as many neutrophils. The longer a person is neutropenic, the greater the risk for infection. </p><br /><a name=\"5\"></a><h1>What can I do about neutropenia?</h1><p>While you are having treatment, you are more likely to get an infection because your body has of fewer neutrophils to fight of germs. People need to watch carefully for early signs of infection. Call your healthcare provider immediately if you have any signs or symptoms of infection. <br /><br />Here are some tips you might find helpful:<br /><br /><h2>ACTIVITY</h2><ul> <li> Take your temperature daily at about the same time or as recommended by your healthcare provider.  This might be up to 4 times per day or every 4 hours if you temperature is up. </li> <li> Keep a record of you temperature on a sheet of paper. </li> <li> Wash your hands often with antibacterial soap when handling raw meat, fruits, or vegetables.  Proper hand washing is especially important after using the bathroom or blowing your nose. </li> <li> Moisturize hands after washing.  This will help skin from cracking. </li> <li> Use electric shavers. </li> <li> Wash all fresh fruits and vegetables carefully with tap water before preparing them.  Try a fruit and vegetable wash such as Fit. </li> <li> Get enough rest and try not to get overly tired. </li> <li> Cover yourself with a blanket if you are chilled or a single sheet if you are hot. </li> <li> Avoid constipation or straining with bowel movements. Use a stool softener daily if needed. </li> <li> Clean your rectal area gently but thoroughly after each bowel movement -- wipe front to back. </li> <li> Wear shoes to prevent cuts on feet. </li> <li> Wear protective gloves when you are gardening or cleaning up after pets. </li> <li> Use deodorant rather than antiperspirant. </li> <li> Bath daily. </li> <li> Do not brush teeth vigorously.  This may injure gums.  Use a soft toothbrush and mild toothpaste. </li> <li> Avoid contact with fresh flowers and plants.  The soil and plants may have bacteria that your body is unable to fight. </li> <li> Avoid contact with animal feces, saliva, or urine. </li> <li> Wash hands after any contact with animals. </li> <li> Do not clean birdcages, cat litter boxes, or dog kennels. </li> <li> Avoid contact with crowds or large groups of people. </li> <li> Avoid people that are sick. </li> <li> Do not attend large or crowded social events when your WBC is low. </li> <li> Do not get manicures, pedicures or pick at your cuticles.  Open sores or nicks around your nails can easily become infected. </li></ul><br /><h2>COMMUNICATION</h2><ul> <li> Report loose stools or diarrhea lasting more than 24 hours to your healthcare provider. </li> <li> Call your healthcare provider if you have a temperature above 100.9 F (38.3 C) or higher than 100.4 F (38.0 C) that lasts for more than an hour.  Do not take any Tylenol&#174; or ibuprofen&#174; products without asking your healthcare provider. </li></ul><br /><h2>DIET</h2><ul> <li> Drink plenty of fluids, including water, popsicles, and fruit juices (at least 8 (8oz.) glasses per day). </li> <li> Avoid eating raw meat or eggs and any fish or shellfish during treatment. </li> <li> Peel and cook fruits and vegetables. </li> <li> Avoid salad bars in restaurants.  (Bacterial growth is encouraged when many people touch the food.) </li></ul><br /><h2>MEDICATION</h2><ul> <li> Do not use enemas or suppositories. </li></ul></p><a name=\"6\"></a><h1>How is neutropenia managed?</h1><p>Your doctor may order a medication called colony stimulating factors (CSFSs) to help your bone marrow produce more white blood cells after your cancer treatment. The most common medications are neupogen and neulasta. These medications can help reduce your risk of infection and also prevent delays in your chemotherapy schedule or lowering of your chemotherapy dose. <br /><br />These medications are given by injection under the skin over a number of days. Your healthcare provider will determine how many days of shots you will need. Many patients and family members learn how to administer the shots at home. </p><br /><a name=\"7\"></a><h1>What can family members and friends do to help me with my neutropenia?</h1><p>Ask family members and friends to: <ul> <li> Keep track of temperature. </li> <li> Wash their hands frequently. </li> <li> Remind you to drink more fluids. </li> <li> Care for your pets. </li> <li> Help wash and prepare fruits and vegetables. </li></ul></p><a name=\"8\"></a><h1>How can I talk to family members and friends about my neutropenia?</h1><p>Here are some ideas that may help you talk to family members and friends:<ul> <li> Tell them how the low white blood count might affect your daily activities. </li> <li> Explain why you need to stay away from crowds of people and people who are sick. </li></ul></p><a name=\"9\"></a><h1>What should I report to my healthcare provider?</h1><p>If you experience any of the following symptoms, report them to your healthcare provider:<ul> <li> Any signs of infection or an overall feeling of being real sick or exhausted. If you have a very low neutrophil count the normal signs of infection, such as pus from a wound, and inflammation (pain, swelling, and redness) may be absent. It is important to know that a fever may be the only sign of an infection. </li> <li> A temperature spike above 100.9 F (38.3 C), or a temperature higher than 100.4 F (38.0 C) that lasts for more than an hour, or as set by your doctor\'s office. </li> <li> Increased skin temp. </li> <li> Body aches. </li> <li> Shaking, chills, or swats. </li> <li> Burning with urination. </li> <li> Headache. </li> <li> Vaginal discharge or itching. </li> <li> Sore throat. </li> <li> Mouth sores. </li> <li> Cough, excess mucous. </li> <li> Feeling confused, dizzy or weak. </li> <li> Redness, swelling or warmth at an intravenous (IV) site, or wound. </li> <li> Pus or drainage from a wound or incision. </li> <li> Diarrhea or loose stools for 24 hours. </li> <li> Productive cough with yellow or green sputum (spit). </li> <li> Difficulty swallowing. </li> <li> Sinus tenderness or nasal congestion. </li> <li> Shortness of breath or painful breathing. </li> <li> Frequent urge to urinate. </li> <li> Pain, burning, redness, swelling or drainage anywhere. </li> <li> Pain with bowel movements. </li> <li> Stomach pain or cramps. </li></ul></p><a name=\"10\"></a><h1>What things should I discuss with my healthcare provider about neutropenia?</h1><p>If you are experiencing neutropenia, you should discuss the following with your healthcare provider at your next appointment:<ul> <li> Is it ok for me to get my flu and/or pneumococcal vaccine? </li> <li> Can I travel with low blood counts? </li> <li> Is it ok for me to be intimate with my spouse or partner? </li> <li> Can I have dental work done? </li> <li> What are my risks of developing neutropenia with the chemotherapy I am taking? </li></ul></p><a name=\"11\"></a><h1>Where can I get more information?</h1><p>For more information, contact the people or organizations at the numbers or websites listed below:<ul> <li> Contact your doctor or nurse. </li> <li> National Cancer Institute: 1-800-4-CANCER or <a href=http://www.cancer.gov/cancerinfo/ target=_blank>http://www.cancer.gov/cancerinfo/</a> Click on coping with cancer.

It is associated with some cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiation. In some people, the cancer itself may contribute to numbness and tingling if it is compressing nerve endings. Numbness and tingling is a sensation that generally occurs in the hands and feet.  It can interfere with walking, driving, ability to sense temperature differences, and other normal daily activities. People experience numbness and tingling differently.  Symptom specifics, such as how severe it is or how long it lasts, will vary from person to person. <br /><br />It is very important that all symptoms are reported to your healthcare provider immediately. Early reporting of numbness and tingling is the best way to decrease the severity and prevent further complications. </p><br /><a name=\"2\"></a><h1>How do people describe numbness and tingling (Peripheral Neuropathy)?</h1><p>People use many different words to describe this sensation. Most people feel it in the hands and feet first, beginning with their fingertips and toes. The tingling, pain, or numbness may move up from the fingers to the hands and from the toes to the feet.  This is called a \"stocking-glove\" pattern (similar to how a person puts on gloves and stockings). <br /><br />The most common symptoms people describe are these:<ul> <li> Tingling - a feeling of needles and pins, and burning. </li> <li> Feeling a sudden, sharp \"stabbing\", pricking or \"electric shock\" pain feeling. </li> <li> Decreased ability to feel changes in temperature, touch, pain or vibration. </li> <li> Loss of balance, difficulty walking like slapping your feet, or stumbling and falling when your toes hit an uneven surface. </li> <li> Clumsiness or dropping things. </li> <li> Difficulty picking up objects, buttoning clothing, brushing teeth, writing or using a fork or spoon. </li> <li> Hearing loss or ringing in the ears. </li> <li> Jaw pain. </li> <li> Constipation, difficulty urinating. </li> <li> Weakness in arms or legs and other muscles. </li> <li> Blurred vision, hoarseness or difficulty speaking. </li></ul><p>Although some symptoms may develop suddenly after your treatment, the numbness and tingling may gradually build up.  It can worsen with each chemotherapy treatment. Usually it is usually more intense right after a treatment and tends to get better just before the next one. Symptoms are normally at their worse 3-5 months after your last treatment.  They may gradually get better over the next several months. However, in some cases it may not get better or totally go away. </p><br /><a name=\"3\"></a><h1>What causes numbness and tingling (Peripheral Neuropathy)?</h1><p>Numbness and tingling is the most common symptom of peripheral nerve damage. Some of the most common chemotherapy drugs known to cause peripheral neuropathy include: <ul> <li> Vincristine (Oncovin&#174;) </li> <li> Vindesine (Eldisine&#174;) </li> <li> Vinorelbine (Navelbine&#174;) </li> <li> Vinblastine (Velban&#174;) </li> <li> Platinol (Cisplatin&#174;) </li> <li> Paraplatin (Carboplatin&#174;) </li> <li> Eloxatin (Oxaliplatin&#174;) </li> <li> Paclitaxel (Taxol&#174;) </li> <li> Docetaxel (Taxotere&#174;) </li> <li> Bortezomib (Velcade&#174;) </li> <li> Thalidomide </li> <li> Procarbazine (Matulane&#174;) </li> <li> Cytarabine (ARA-C&#174;) </li> <li> Vespide (Etoposide&#174;, vp-16) </li> <li> Alfa-interferon </li></ul><p>High doses of chemotherapy tend to cause more numbness and tingling.  Individuals at the greatest risk of developing numbness and tingling with chemotherapy are those people who already have conditions that increase their risk, these include: <ul> <li> Diabetes </li> <li> Alcoholism </li> <li> Severe malnutrition </li> <li> Advanced age </li> <li> Prior chemotherapy </li></ul></p><a name=\"4\"></a><h1>What can I do about numbness and tingling (Peripheral Neuropathy)?</h1><p>Although most of the time it is not possible to prevent early nerve damage, it is possible to prevent it from getting worse. The most important thing that you can do is to tell your healthcare provider immediately if feel any numbness and tingling. Then, you and your healthcare provider can talk about whether your treatment should be changed. \nHere are some tips you might find helpful:<br /><br /><h2>ACTIVITY</h2><ul> <li> Pay close attention when you walk.  You may be able to tell if your toes and feet have been affected. This can help you avoid falls. </li> <li> Turn lights on before entering a room. </li> <li> Keep rooms bright enough that you can see all areas where you need to walk or do other activities. </li> <li> Keep a night light in your room and along the path you walk during the night if you get up. </li> <li> Move furniture at home so you have a clear pathway. </li> <li> Remove objects from the floor to help prevent falls, such as clutter or throw rugs. </li> <li> Avoid slippery wet floors.  Wipe up liquids immediately. </li> <li> Put a non-slip rubber mat or self-stick strips on the floor of the bathroom or shower. </li> <li> Use over-the-tub handgrips or install shower grips. </li> <li> Use soap dispensers instead of bar soap, which can easily slip out of your hands. </li> <li> Use a non-breakable water thermometer to check your bath or dishwater temperature before you wash dishes or bathe.  Mae sure that water is not hotter than 110 F (43.3C).  This will help prevent injury to your kin.    This is important if you are having trouble feeling changes in temperature. </li> <li> Avoid extremes of hot and cold. </li> <li> Avoid sudden chilling, such as reaching into a refrigerator or freezer, air conditioning in the summer, drinking ice-cold drinks, eating ice cream or other cold foods and cold showers. </li> <li> Try wearing gloves and a scarf when opening a refrigerator or going into an air-conditioned room. </li> <li> Use rubber gloves to wash dishes.  The gloves will protect your hands from very hot water. </li> <li> Use a potholder when cooking to avoid further injury to nerve endings. </li> <li> Use a cane or walker if you are unsteady when walking or have weakness. </li> <li> Wear sturdy shoes.  Do not wear slippers and running shoes with thick soles. </li> <li> Wear gloves and warm cotton socks in the winter. </li> <li> Inspect your skin daily for abrasions, burns, and cuts.  Carefully inspect your arms, legs, fingers and toes. </li> <li> Consider having manicures if your hands are painful -- but do not have your cuticles cut.  This can increase your risk for infections. </li> <li> Pay special attention when trimming your toenails.  You may not feel small cuts on your toes.  Have a pedicure or see a podiatrist for foot care. </li> <li> Physical therapy may help with strengthening weak muscles. </li> <li> Exercise- especially swimming and walking. </li> <li> Occupational therapy to assist with daily activities </li> <li> Massage is relaxing, which can help decrease pain. </li></ul><br /><h2>COMMUNICATION</h2><ul> <li> Discuss with your healthcare provider your current driving skills and ability to feel the gas and brake pedals, steering wheel and any changes in reaction time. </li> <li> Your healthcare provider may refer you to occupational therapy to help with assistive devices, such as special pens, pencils and utensils.  These assistive devices are designed so that you can hold them more easily.  You may also need clothes and shoes with Velcro&#174; straps and jewelry without fasteners. Inspect your skin daily for abrasions, burns and cuts; especially your arms, legs, fingers and toes. </li></ul><br /><h2>DIET</h2><ul> <li> Avoid cold beverages, chewing ice or using straws. </li> <li> Drink at least 6-8 glasses of water a day to prevent constipation.  Eat a high fiber diet.  Talk to your healthcare provider about taking a stool softener or a laxative is you become constipated. </li></ul><br /><h2>PSYCHOLOGICAL</h2><ul> <li> Deep breathing, relaxation, and guided imagery can help with pain </li></ul></p><a name=\"5\"></a><h1>How is numbness and tingling (peripheral neuropathy) managed?</h1><p><h4>Medications</h4><p>Your healthcare provider may order a medication to help manage the pain and discomfort associated with peripheral neuropathy. Some to the medications that might be prescribed include: <ul> <li> Antidepressants may be used if your primary symptoms are tingling and burning pain. The use of antidepressants does not mean that your pain is imagined, or that you are depressed. </li> <li> Antiseizure medication is commonly used if your primary symptoms include sharp, stabbing pains. </li> <li> Topical creams are to be rubbed on the painful parts of the hands and feet. The most commonly used cream is Capsaicin (Zostrix&#174;) made of chili pepper extract. The cream may burn when first applied to the skin but the burning passes with continued use. </li> <li> Pain medication may be helpful when used with the antidepressants or anti-seizure medications. Lidocaine patches have a numbing effect and are placed directly on the skin over the painful areas. </li></ul><p>Be sure to talk to your healthcare provider before starting any over the counter or other medication. Some medications may interact with your treatment, or with the drugs that you are taking to improve your numbness and tingling. You should never take any medications, herbal remedies, or other over the counter substances without talking to your healthcare provider first. </p><h4>Non-medication</h4><p>Several non-medication approaches have been reported to help people with numbness, tingling and pain these include: <ul> <li> Deep breathing, relaxation and guided imagery helpful particularly to with pain. </li> <li> Acupuncture. </li> <li> Physical therapy may help with strengthening weak muscles. </li> <li> Exercise -- especially swimming and walking. </li> <li> Occupational therapy to assist with daily activities. </li> <li> Massage is relaxing, which can help decrease pain. </li> <li> Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) is a method of applying a gentle electric current to the skin to relieve pain. </li></ul></p><a name=\"6\"></a><h1>What can family members and friends do to help me with my numbness and tingling?</h1><p>Ask family members and friends to:<ul> <li> Prepare meals for you. </li> <li> Help with daily household chores such as gardening or dishwashing. </li> <li> Help with dressing and shopping to purchase shoes and clothes with Velcro&#174; closures. </li> <li> Get objects off the floor and make sure rugs are taped securely to the floor. </li> <li> Help insert thermometers in sinks and tubes. </li> <li> Install brighter light bulbs and make sure that all pathways are well lit. </li> <li> Buy liquid soap in a dispenser instead of bar soap. </li> <li> Help with transportation. </li> <li> Do exercises with you, such as walking to improve strength, balance and coordination. </li></ul></p><a name=\"7\"></a><h1>How can I talk to my family members about my numbness and tingling (Peripheral Neuropathy)?</h1><p>Here are some ideas that may help you talk to family members and friends:<ul> <li> Be open and honest when telling family members and friends about difficulties you have with numbness and tingling. </li> <li> Ask family members and friends for suggestions to help you function as close to your normal activity level as possible. </li> <li> Tell family members and friends how the numbness and tingling is affecting your emotions and life. </li> <li> Ask family members and friends how the numbness and tingling is affecting them. </li> <li> Talk to your family and friends about any concerns regarding your safety or any help you need to perform your daily activities. </li></ul></p><a name=\"8\"></a><h1>What should I report to my healthcare provider about my numbness and tingling?</h1><p>If you experience any of the following symptoms, report them to your healthcare provider:<ul> <li> Changes in physical function, pain, numbness, prickling or tingling that interfere with your ability to care for yourself. </li> <li> Moderate to severe weakness in your arms and legs that make it difficult to do daily activities. </li> <li> Severe numbness, pain, burning or tingling in your hands or feet that make it difficult to do daily activities. </li> <li> Changes in your sense of touch in your hands/fingers, or feet/toes or mouth area that make it difficult to do daily activities. </li> <li> Difficulty in swallowing, breathing, drinking or chewing food, or muscle spasms in mouth /jaws, hands/fingers or feet/toes that makes daily activities difficult. </li> <li> Any new problems with walking, balance or coordination. </li> <li> Difficulty urinating or constipation. </li> <li> Blurred vision, ringing in ears. </li> <li> Any falls, burns or other injuries to your affected hands and feet, or any other body part. </li> <li> Need for special equipment. </li> <li> Stumbling or falling from numbness in feet. </li> <li> Any new over-the-counter or prescription medications. </li></ul></p><a name=\"9\"></a><h1>What things should I discuss with my healthcare provider about my numbness and tingling (Peripheral Neuropathy)?</h1><p>If you are experiencing numbness and tingling, you should discuss the following with your healthcare provider at your next appointment:<ul> <li> Are the chemotherapy medications that I am taking likely to cause numbness and tingling? </li> <li> Am I at special risk for developing numbness and tingling? </li> <li> Does numbness and tingling usually go away after the treatment is finished? </li> <li> If I get numbness and tingling will it interfere with my chemotherapy treatment? </li> <li> Is there anything that you recommend to prevent numbness and tingling? </li> <li> How have you managed numbness and tingling in other patients?

It is a hard symptom to understand. Pain is whatever a person says it is, happening whenever he/she says it does. <br /><br />Pain can decrease appetite and activity levels, make sleeping difficult, and cause anxious or depressed feelings.  There is no need for anyone to be in constant pain.  Your healthcare provider can and should help you control your pain.</p><br /><a name=\"2\"></a><h1>How do people describe pain?</h1><p>People describe pain in many ways.  Pain can be described as aching, gnawing, and concentrate in on area.  Pain can also be vague and be localized in a general area of the body.  It can be sharp and intense, tingling or numbing. Pain can also be described as burning. It can come on suddenly or gradually. Pain that lasts for a period of time is chronic pain.  People can also have periods of very intense acute pain. </p><br /><a name=\"3\"></a><h1>What causes pain?</h1><p>There are many causes of pain. Cancer can grow and press into surrounding tissue, causing pain.  Cancer can also spread to other areas of the body, causing new pain.  Pain can result from tissue damage during surgery, or pressure on nerves, such as compression caused by a tumor. Cancer drugs can damage the nerves in fingers, hands, toes and feet.  Even mouth sores can cause pain.</p><br /><a name=\"4\"></a><h1>What can I do about pain?</h1><p>Every person experiences pain differently.  Cancer pain is controllable in more than 90% of cases.  Some pain may be difficult to control, however there are things that can be done to allow you to function.  Beginning a pain management program early will help you to keep doing your daily activities.<br /><br />Here are some tips you might find helpful:<br /><br /><h2>ACTIVITY</h2><ul> <li> Rate your level of pain on a scale of 0-10 (0 = none, 1-3 = mild, 4-6 = moderate, and 7-10 = severe). </li> <li> Keep a diary to keep track of your pain experience.  Include in your diary: where and when the pain occurs, how long it lasts, what makes it worse, things that relieve the pain (such as heat, ice or drugs), and the length of time it took for the pain-relieving method to work.  This information may help your healthcare provider manage your pain. </li> <li> Try putting heat or cold on the area of pain. Wrap your heating pad or ice pack in a towel to protect your skin. </li> <li> Use pillows to keep pressure off your area of pain. </li></ul><br /><h2>COMMUNICATION</h2><ul> <li> Ask your doctor for something to control any nausea associated with taking pain medication.  Some people are nauseated even when taking the correct dose of pain medication. </li></ul><br /><h2>MEDICATION</h2><ul> <li> Take the pain medicine exactly as prescribed.  For chronic pain, medications should be given round-the-clock on a schedule instead of only when the pain is severe.  Check with your healthcare provider if the schedule needs to be adjusted. </li> <li> Do not wait until your pain is severe to take your pain medication. </li> <li> Avoid crushing or breaking your pain pills unless you check with your healthcare provider.  Do not break any long acting or time-release form of pain medications. </li> <li> Ask to be put on a preventative laxative regimen if you are taking opioid pain medication.  This will help you to avoid constipation. </li> <li> Do not drive or operate any equipment until you are sure of the effects from the medication.  Pain medication can make you dizzy, drowsy, or sleepy.   This may get better after a few days, but you may need help getting up or walking. </li> <li> Keep at least one-week supply of pain medication on hand.  Let your doctor or nurse know well in advance when you need more medication. </li> <li> Avoid suddenly stopping any of your pain medicines.  Instead, reduce the dosage gradually as the pain decreases.  Talk with your healthcare provider before stopping any medication. </li></ul></p><a name=\"5\"></a><h1>How is pain managed?</h1><p>Pain can be managed with medication regimens, non-medication approaches, or a combination of both.  Talk to your healthcare provider about which pain management strategies are right for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Medications </h4>\r\n<p>You should never take any medications, herbal remedies, or other over-the-counter substances without talking to your healthcare provider first.  Some medications may interact with your treatment or with the drugs that you are taking to decrease your pain include: <br /><br />Mild pain (non-prescription)<ul> <li> Aspirin&#174; </li> <li> Tylenol&#174; </li> <li> Advil&#174; </li> <li> ibuprofen&#174; </li> <li> Motrin&#174; </li></ul>\r\n<p>Your doctor may order medication to help manage the pain.  Some of the medications that might be used include (prescription required):<br /><br />Moderate to severe pain (opioids/narcotics)<ul> <li> Codeine (with Aspirin&#174; or Tylenol&#174;) </li> <li> Oxycodone (with Aspirin&#174; or Tylenol&#174;) </li> <li> Hydrocodone (with Aspirin&#174; or Tylenol&#174;) </li> <li> Morphine </li> <li> Hydromorphone </li> <li> Dilaudid </li> <li> Methadone </li> <li> Fentanyl </li></ul>\r\n<p>Steroids, antidepressants and anti-seizure medications are also commonly used for moderate to severe pain control.<br /><br />If you are having problems swallowing pills or are nauseated, many of these medications come in liquid form or patches you can place on your skin.  For people that need multiple doses of narcotic pain medication, a doctor may prescribe a long acting or time-released medication.  Do not be afraid to take opioids because you think you might become hooked or addicted.  This problem is very rare in cancer patients, occurring in about 1 in 10,000 patients,</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Non-medication</h4>\r\n<p>Several non-medication approaches that have been reported to help people with pain include: <ul> <li> Deep breathing, relaxation and guided imagery are particularly helpful with pain. </li> <li> Acupuncture. </li> <li> Physical therapy may help with strengthening weak muscles. </li> <li> Exercise, especially swimming and walking. </li> <li> Occupational therapy to assist with daily activities. </li> <li> Massage is relaxing, which can help decrease pain. </li> <li> Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) is a method of applying a gentle electric current to the skin to relieve pain. </li> <li> Counseling or support groups. </li> <li> Distraction activities, such as watching TV or listening to music. </li></ul></p>\r\n\r\n<a name=\"6\"></a><h1>What can family members and friends do to help me with my pain?</h1>\r\n<p>Ask family members and friends to: <ul> <li> Help position you so you can be more comfortable. </li> <li> Call your healthcare provider if your pain medication is not helping to decrease your pain. </li> <li> Call your healthcare provider if your pain level is above 5. </li> <li> Give you a gentle backrub with warmed lotion. </li> <li> Watch for confusion and dizziness, especially after new medicines are started or when doses are changed. </li> <li> Encourage pleasant distractions, such as watching movies, or playing games. </li> <li> Offer plenty of fluids and foods with fiber. </li> <li> Remind you to take your pain medication as prescribed.  Help you to stay on schedule. </li> <li> Help you to remember to take the stool softeners and laxatives that your healthcare provider suggested to prevent constipation. </li> <li> Help you keep an updated list of all the medication you are on, and any side effects that you have had with any of your medications. </li></ul></p>\r\n\r\n<a name=\"7\"></a><h1>How can I talk to my family members about my pain?</h1>\r\n<p>Here are some ideas that may help you talk to family members and friends:<ul> <li> Try saying where your pain is, and how severe your pain is on a 0-10 (0 = none, 1-3 = mild, 4-6 = moderate, and 7-10 = severe).  If the pain is a 5 or above, contact your healthcare provider. </li> <li> Use descriptive words, such as sharp or aching, to describe your pain to family members and friends. </li> <li> Tell your family members and friends how many hours per day you have the pain. </li> <li> Tell your family members and friends how your pain is affecting your emotions. </li> <li> Ask family members and friends for suggestions to help manage your pain. </li></ul></p><a name=\"8\"></a><h1>What should I report to my healthcare provider about my pain?</h1><p>If you experience any of the following symptoms, report them to your healthcare provider:<ul> <li> Pain not relieved by current medication. </li> <li> Any pain that is a 5 or higher on a 0-10 scale. </li> <li> Number of hours per day you have pain and how long it lasts after taking something for relief. </li> <li> Pain that is new or different from your last visit to your healthcare provider. </li> <li> Pain with a cough or fever greater than 100.4 degrees Farenheit (38.0 C) for more than 24 hours. </li> <li> Unbearable side effects to pain medication, such as uncontrolled constipation. </li> <li> Pain along with fatigue, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal bloating. </li> <li> Pain that is getting worse despite using a pain medication schedule (taking pain medication throughout the day and night). </li> <li> Location of pain. </li> <li> Unable to take anything by mouth, including the pain medicine. </li> <li> Confusion or becoming disoriented. </li> <li> Any questions about taking medication. </li></ul></p>\r\n\r\n<a name=\"9\"></a><h1>What things should I discuss with my healthcare provider about pain?</h1>\r\n<p>If you are experiencing pain, you should discuss the following with your healthcare provider at your next appointment:<ul> <li> Who will be managing my pain medications? </li> <li> What is causing my pain? </li> <li> Do you have information or counseling available to help manage my pain? </li> <li> How much medicine should I take? How often? </li> <li> If my pain is not relieved, can I take more?

This is called breakthrough pain. It can occur with or without activity, and usually occurs without warning. Breakthrough pain is pain that is present without warning that gets beyond the control of pain medication before it is time to take your next dose.</p><br /><a name=\"2\"></a><h1>How do people describe breakthrough pain?</h1><p>People with cancer pain often notice that their pain changes throughout the day. Break through pain is more intense than the pain you have been having over a period of hours or days, in spite of taking pain medication around the clock. If you are consistently experiencing pain just before it is time to take your medication as part of your pain management plan, this is not true \"break through pain\", but rather an indication that the dose of the fixed medication needs to be adjusted (increased).<br /><br />While breakthrough pain flares may vary in length, intensity, or cause, the typical episode reaches peak intensity in as little as 3 minutes and lasts an average of 30 minutes.</p><br /><a name=\"3\"></a><h1>What causes breakthrough pain?</h1><p>Breakthrough pain occurs when your pain medication is no longer at a level sufficient to control your pain. This kind of pain can happen unexpectedly for no obvious reason, or it may be triggered by a specific activity, like coughing, moving, or going to the bathroom. Most people who have breakthrough cancer pain experience several episodes a day.</p><br /><a name=\"4\"></a><h1>What can I do about breakthrough pain?</h1><p>Almost all people experiencing chronic cancer pain should receive pain medication for around-the-clock pain control and a medication specifically for treatment of breakthrough pain. Current medicines used to treat breakthrough pain include immediate release morphine tablets, capsules, or solution. In addition, there is a fentanyl swab that provides fast relief from pain, available by prescription. When breakthrough pain occurs, it is time to take the shorter acting medication no matter when you last took the longer acting medication. If breakthrough pain continues to happen, despite using your medication at the prescribed time and amount, it is time to call your healthcare providers.<br /><br />Here are some tips people have found helpful:<br /><br /><h2>ACTIVITY</h2><ul> <li> Keep a pain diary.  When does your breakthrough pain happen?  Rate your pain on a 0-10 scale at set times throughout the day, (0=no pain at all and 10= the worst pain you have ever experienced). Write the new rating in the journal, along with the time it happened.  Keeping track of these details will help your doctor or nurse make recommendations for you. </li></ul><br /><h2>MEDICATIONS</h2><ul> <li> Use a laxative and/or stool softener, because cancer pain medication can make you very constipated.  Talk to your doctor or nurse about this. </li></ul><br /><h2>PSYCHOLOGICAL</h2><ul> <li> Use techniques, including relaxation training, imagery, and distraction. </li> <li> Listen to relaxing music, or a funny television program to help distract you. </li></ul></p><a name=\"5\"></a><h1>What can family members and friends do to help me with breakthrough pain?</h1><p>Ask family members and friends to:<ul> <li> Keep track of the details in your pain journal. </li> <li> Remind you when it\'s time to call your healthcare provider. </li> <li> Give you a gentle backrub, with warm lotion if this is relaxing. </li></ul></p><a name=\"6\"></a><h1>How can I talk with my family members and friends or others about my breakthrough pain?</h1><p>Here are some ideas that may help you talk to family members and friends:<ul> <li> Tell your family members and friends how the pain is affecting your ability to do usual daily activities. </li> <li> Tell your family members and friends by using your pain journal to explain your pattern of pain (how long it lasts, where the pain is, does it radiate anywhere, how you would describe it, what helps make the pain better, what makes the pain worse). </li></ul></p><a name=\"7\"></a><h1>What should I report to my healthcare provider about my breakthrough pain?</h1><p>If you are experiencing any of the following symptoms, report them to your healthcare provider:<ul> <li> Pain not relieved by current medication, and that you report as a 5 or higher on a scale from 0-10 (0=no pain at all and 10=worst pain you have ever experienced). </li> <li> How many hours per day you have pain, and how long the pain lasts after taking something for relief. </li> <li> Pain that is new or different from your last doctor\'s visit, worsening pain or a change in your pain. </li> <li> Pain that accompanies a cough or fever greater than 100.4 F (38.0 C) for more than 24 hours. </li> <li> Unbearable side effects to pain medication (example: uncontrolled constipation). </li> <li> Pain along with fatigue, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal bloating. </li> <li> Pain that is worsening despite using a pain medication schedule (taking pain medication throughout the day and night) in the right amounts and time schedule. </li> <li> Inability to do or carry out usual daily activities. </li></ul></p><a name=\"8\"></a><h1>What things should I discuss with my healthcare provider about breakthrough pain?</h1><p>If you are experiencing breakthrough pain, you should discuss the following with your healthcare provider at your next appointment:<ul> <li> How often can I take the fast acting pain medication?

It may affect all of the skin or be localized to one part of the body. Rashes can irritate the skin by causing it to itch, change colors, become warm, bumpy, dry, crack or blister. Swelling and pain can also occur. If you are receiving chemotherapy it is important to let your healthcare provider know when you develop a rash. It will be important for you to describe the appearance of the rash, where it is located, when it first appeared, and any symptoms you are experiencing.</p><br /><a name=\"2\"></a><h1>How do people describe rash?</h1><p>Rash is a general term for a skin reaction. There are many terms used to describe what the rash looks like such as:<ul> <li> Erythematous - Redness. </li> <li> Macular - Small, distinct, flat areas. </li> <li> Papular - Small raised lesions. </li> <li> Macular-Papular - Usually bright red in color. The skin may feel hot, burning, or itchy. </li> <li> Hives (uticaria) - Round, raised, itchy, or red blotches, which may be pale in the center and red around the outside. </li> <li> Follicular eruptions - Tiny sacs on the skin surface from which hair grows.  These eruptions look very similar to acne. Some doctors call it an acne-like rash. Follicular eruptions are raised and can be filled with pus have a yellow drainage. </li> <li> Itching (or pruitis) - A peculiar tingling or uneasy irritation of the skin that causes a desire to scratch the affected area. Itching may be over the whole body (generalized), or only in a particular location (localized). </li> <li> Flushing - A temporary redness of the face and neck caused by swelling of the blood vessels. </li> <li> Blistering - Round raised areas of fluid under the upper layer of the skin, which can weep or drain clear fluid. </li> <li> Honey yellow crusting - Yellowish-brown crust over the red eruptions with oozing of fluid from lesions may indicate a bacterial infection. </li></ul></p><a name=\"3\"></a><h1>What causes a rash?</h1><p>It is very important that you understand the side effects of your chemotherapy treatment. Many chemotherapy drugs can cause rashes and skin changes. Some of the skin reactions can develop immediately during treatment or within the first 36 hours after receiving your treatment. This is an acute allergic or hypersensitivity reaction causing hives, flushing and itching. It is very important that you let your healthcare provider know immediately if you experience this type of rash. This is your body\'s protective immune response to a foreign substance that has entered the body, such as chemotherapy. This is not a common reaction, but is more common with certain chemotherapy drugs, such as, Paclitaxel, Bleomycin, L-Asparaginase, Docetaxel, Cisplatin, Carbotaxol and Monoclonal Antibodies. <b>Ask your healthcare provider if your chemotherapy might cause a reaction</b>.<br /><br /><b>Allergic drug rashes can also be delayed developing within days or weeks after your treatment.</b> This type of skin rash usually develops on the back of the body. The arms and legs are often involved however, the face is not usually affected. This rash is usually bright red in color, and the skin will feel hot and burning. It is very important to let your healthcare provider know all the medications that you are currently taking and whether you have any medication allergies or history of allergic reactions.<br /><br />There are many new chemotherapy drugs that are associated with rashes. Scientists have developed numerous new drugs that appear to be effective treatments for many different kinds of cancer. Known as <b>targeted treatments</b>, these drugs are designed to prevent cancer cells from getting nourished, growing, dividing, and possibly spreading.  Targeted treatments are different than chemotherapy.  Unlike chemotherapy, which can harm healthy cells as it kills cancer cells, targeted treatments focus on blocking cancer cell growth and killing cancer cells.  Treatments may be given in combination with chemotherapy or alone as a single treatment.<br /><br />In particular, one type of targeted treatment blocks the epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs), which can cause rashes and dry skin.  These rashes are not an allergic response.  They are a side effect from the drug itself.  EGFR - blocking drugs that commonly cause a rash include Cetuximab (Erbitux&#174;), Erlotinib (Tarceva&#174;), Gefitinib (Iressa&#174;) and Panitumumab (Vectibix&#174;). <br /><br />Another type of targeted treatment blocks the development of blood vessels that feed tumors.  It is called vascular endothelial growth factors receptors (VEGFRs).  VEGF - blocking drugs include Sorafenib (Nexavar&#174;) and Sunitinib (Sutent&#174;).<br /><br />These rashes usually appear within 1-3 weeks of treatment. The rash is characterized by an acne-like rash with pustules.  Generally, they first appear on the face, particularly around the nose or on the cheeks.  However, the rash may also appear on the back, arms and legs. The severity of the rash may come and go during your treatment. Typically the rash clears up within 1-2 months after your treatment is completed. The rash normally does not require you to stop your treatment. Some studies have suggested that the rash may actually be a positive sign that your body is responding to the drug. <b>It is very important that you notify your healthcare provider if this rash develops.  This rash is NOT acne.  Do not treat it with acne medication</b>.</p><br /><a name=\"4\"></a><h1>What can I do about rash?</h1><p>Here are some tips you might find helpful:<br /><br /><h2>ACTIVITY</h2><ul> <li> Wear loose soft cotton clothing. </li> <li> Use a mild moisturizing soap without perfumes when bathing.  Examples of mild moisturizing soaps are Dove&#174;, Ivory&#174; Skin Cleansing Liquid Gel, Cetaphil&#174;, Neutrogena&#174; and Aveeno&#174;. </li> <li> Pat skin gently after washing the area with a clean soft towel or washcloth. </li> <li> Avoid exposing your skin to temperature extremes.  Try not to use hot lamps, ice packs, heating pads and electric blankets. </li> <li> Treat dry skin with emollient lotions, such as: Eucerin&#174; Cream, Cetaphil&#174; Cream, Bag&#174; Balm, Udder&#174; Cream, Zim\'s&#174; Crack Cream, Aquaphor&#174; ointment, Vanicream&#174;, Neutrogena&#174;, or Vaseline&#174; Intensive Care (dye free & alcohol free). </li> <li> Treat itchy skin with the emollient lotions listed above and Aveeno&#174; Baths, Sarna&#174; Ultra Cream, Regenecare&#174; Gel, Gold Bond&#174; Powder and Sweet cream. </li> <li> Strong gloves will help avoid skin contact with friction and harsh chemicals, which can further damage your skin.  Wear light cotton gloves when gardening or doing outdoor work.  Put on rubber or latex gloves before washing dishes. </li> <li> Use Band-Aid&#174; brand Liquid Bandage, Bag&#174; Balm, and Zim\'s&#174; Crack Cream for cracks and fissures. </li> <li> For inflammation around your fingernails try soaking your fingertips in a solution of white vinegar diluted 1:10 in tap water for 5 minutes a day. </li> <li> Wash your clothes and other fabrics that come in direct contact with your skin in mild hypoallergenic detergents.  Deft and Tide make a hypoallergenic laundry soap.  Read the label to be sure that buy the correct type. </li> <li> Avoid tanning beds. </li> <li> Wear sunscreen everyday, even on cloudy days.  Your sensitivity to the sun has increased.  Wearing long sleeves and long pants can help but you still need to wear sunscreen.  A new ingredient called Helioplex keeps a sunscreen from breaking down.  Helioplex is gentle on sensitive skin and can be found in several Neutrogena sunscreens, including Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry Tough Sunblock SPF 55. </li> <li> Wear a hat. </li> <li> DO NOT treat the rash with acne medication such as Clearasil&#174;, Oxy&#174;, Benzoyl&#174; Peroxide&#174;, or Stridex&#174;. </li> <li> Makeup is safe to use, but avoid makeup products that contain many ingredients. </li> <li> Avoid lotions, creams and soaps that contain alcohol, perfumes, or dyes.  These ingredients may increase dryness and can cause further skin irritation. </li></ul><br /><h2>COMMUNICATION</h2><ul> <li> Call your healthcare provider immediately if a new rash appears before your next appointment. </li></ul><br /><h2>DIET</h2><ul> <li> Drink 8 (8oz.) glasses of water or other non-caffeinated drinks every day.  Avoid caffeine (i.e. colas, coffee) when possible.  Caffeine can cause dehydration. </li></ul><br /><h2>MEDICATION</h2><ul> <li> Ask your healthcare provider if a topical or oral medication is right for you. They may be able to prescribe one. </li></ul></p><a name=\"5\"></a><h1>What can family and friends do to help with my rash?</h1><p>Ask family and friends to:<ul> <li> Help select proper lotions for dryness and itching. </li> <li> Help remind you to wear sunscreen when outside. </li> <li> Help apply medications and lotions to skin if necessary. </li> <li> Assist you with chores around the house. </li> <li> Help bathing to keep skin clean. </li> <li> Help by letting your healthcare provider know if rashes or itching occur. </li></ul></p><a name=\"6\"></a><h1>How can I talk with my family members and friends about my rash?</h1><p>Here are some ideas that may help you talk to family members and friends:<ul> <li> Describe how having a rash makes you feel. </li> <li> Ask your family member how your rash is affecting them. </li> <li> Ask family members for support or suggestion to help cope with the rash. </li> <li> Tell family members what feels good and helps with the rash. </li> <li> Try describing how the itching or rash may interfere with your usual activities. </li></ul></p><a name=\"7\"></a><h1>Drugs that may be prescribed by your healthcare provider</h1><p><ul> <li> Topical steroid creams are currently not recommended. </li> <li> Topical antibiotics creams may include: </li><br /><ul> <li> Clindamycin</li> <li>Erythromycin<br/><br/></ul> <li> Antibiotics taken by mouth in pill form may include: </li><br /><ul> <li> Tetracyline</li> <li>Minocylcline</li> <li>Doxycycline<br/><br/></ul> <li> Mild, localized itching may benefit from a topical antihistamine cream like Benadryl&#174;. Oral antihistamine drugs, such as, Benadryl&#174;, Claritin&#174;, or Allegra&#174; are all available over the counter and can be helpful for severe itching.  If the rash hurts, pain medications may be prescribed. </li></ul></p><a name=\"8\"></a><h1>What should I report to my healthcare provider about my rash?</h1><p>If you experience any of the following symptoms, report them to your healthcare provider:<ul> <li> Report all rashes even if they are not causing you discomfort. Not all rashes require treatment. </li> <li> Any new fever reading above 100.9 (38.3), or a temperature higher than 100.4 F (38.0 C) that lasts for more than an hour.

People with delirium may feel confused, excited, or disoriented. </p><br /><a name=\"2\"></a><h1>How do people describe difficulty remembering things?</h1><p>People may describe cognitive impairment as mental fatigue, \"chemo brain\", or \"brain fog\". This includes problems with distraction, feeling exhausted by tasks that require mental energy, or problems with handling complex information. In more extreme cases people may have difficulty with their sleep/wake cycle, mood changes, disorganized thinking and speech, inability to concentrate, or short-term memory loss.<br /><br />People often notice these problems during their chemotherapy treatment. Within one year of treatment, people find that these symptoms are greatly improved or no longer exist. However for some people, \"chemo brain\" can continue for years following the completion of treatment.</p><br /><a name=\"3\"></a><h1>What causes difficulty remembering things?</h1><p>The primary causes of cognitive problems are the cancer itself and the treatments involved in working to cure it. Other things that can contribute to cognitive problems are: <ul> <li> The central nervous system, including the brain, is particularly sensitive to many cancer treatments. Cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and immunotherapy are not precise. They affect more parts of your body than just where the cancer tumor is located. </li> <li> Poor nutrition. Low levels of iron, Vitamin B and folic acid can decrease a person\'s memory and abilities to pay attention or speak. </li> <li> Medicine.

It is also described as decreased libido (interest in sex), the inability to achieve or maintain sexual arousal, or the delay or absence of orgasm.</p><br /><a name=\"2\"></a><h1>How do people describe sexual dysfunction?</h1><p>Sexual dysfunction can be a loss (or decrease) of interest in sex, changes in sexual desire, difficulty enjoying sexual activities, or pain in genital area during intercourse. It may appear as vaginal dryness in women, erectile dysfunction or problems with ejaculation in men. </p><br /><a name=\"3\"></a><h1>What causes sexual dysfunction?</h1><p>Sexual dysfunction after cancer treatment can be caused by hormonal changes, excessive fatigue, pain, discomfort, or changes in self-image. Sometimes the physical toll of the treatments and the resulting side effects, such as nausea and fatigue, may reduce the desire for sexual activity. Concerns over ability to perform and attractiveness after cancer treatment may also cause a person to lose their desire or arousal. </p><br /><a name=\"4\"></a><h1>What can I do about sexual dysfunction?</h1><p>Here are some tips you might find helpful:<br /><br /><h2>ACTIVITY</h2><ul> <li> Take a nap before sex to reduce fatigue. </li> <li> Avoid temperature extremes in the room.  Temperature extremes can cause your body to use extra energy to adjust. </li> <li> Explore various ways of sharing pleasure and intimacy with your partner , such as touching, cuddling, caressing, holding hands, hugging and kissing.  Sexual intercourse is not the only way to be intimate. Be creative. </li> <li> Take time for intimacy with your partner. </li> <li> Assume a comfortable position for intercourse.  For instance lying on your side can use less energy. </li> <li> Let your partner know if any types of touching cause pain.  Show your partner what feels good to you or positions that are not painful. </li></ul><br /><h2>COMMUNICATION</h2><ul> <li> Talk to your healthcare provider if a sexual problem has not resolved after you have tried some of these suggestions.  Your healthcare provider may refer you to a specialist or sex therapist. </li></ul><br /><h2>MEDICATION</h2><ul> <li> Use water-soluble lubricants such as K-Y&#174; Jelly or Astroglide&#174; if you have vaginal dryness.  These lubricants can reduce friction and irritation to the penis and vagina during intercourse. </li> <li> Take medication about 30 minutes to 1 hour before intercourse if you feel nauseated or are having pain. </li></ul></p><a name=\"5\"></a><h1>What can my partners do about my sexual dysfunction?</h1><p>Ask your partner to: <ul> <li> Share their feelings and desires, as well as concerns and worries. </li> <li> Use some tools (such as erotic pictures, lubrication or a vibrator) to stimulate or increase arousal or to decrease your discomfort. </li></ul></p><a name=\"6\"></a><h1>How can I talk to my partner about sexual dysfunction?</h1><p>Many patients and their partners are fearful or anxious about their first sexual experience after treatment.

However, many people have a difficult time talking with their healthcare provider. Some feel uncomfortable asking questions or talking about their illness and treatment because they\'re afraid they might look foolish or ask a silly question.<br /><br />Others may have difficulty because they see their healthcare provider as a powerful person. Some are afraid if they report too many things, their treatment will stop.  It is important to be open with your healthcare providers and talk with them about your concerns.</p><br /><a name=\"2\"></a><h1>How do I talk with my healthcare provider to get the information I need?</h1><p>It is reasonable to assume the medical staff wants to help you and would like to give you the information you need.<ul> <li> Buy a notebook and write down all the questions you want to ask. Include any symptoms you\'ve been experiencing and how they are impacting your daily activities. </li> <li> Bring a friend or family member to your appointment to take notes or help you ask questions. </li> <li> Speak frankly with your doctor. Express your feelings.  Let others know how you feel. </li> <li> Take notes during the appointment. </li> <li> Ask permission to tape record the visit so you can use it as a reminder at home. </li></ul></p><a name=\"3\"></a><h1>What should I tell my healthcare provider?</h1><p>Different items to bring up with your healthcare provider:<ul> <li> Tell them about any problems. Examples are: <br/><br/> <ul> <li> Symptoms to report - How often throughout the day/week they occur?  What makes it worse or better?  What you are doing for symptom relief?</li> <li> Symptom severity - On a scale of 0-10 (0=no symptom to 10=worst imaginable symptom), how severe is the symptom?</li> <li> Physical functioning problems - On a scale of 0-10 (0=no problem to 10=many problems functioning), are you having any problems functioning? What makes it worse or better?</li> <li> Need for assistance with physical function or managing symptoms.</li> <li> Problems with doing your daily activities.</li> <li> Emotional problems, such as anger, sadness or anxiety.</li> <li> Financial problems because of your cancer or cancer treatment.</li> <li> When you have questions about what is happening to you.</li> <li> When you have decisions to make.</ul></li> <li> Repeat what you understand about your cancer or cancer treatment.  Ask if what you said is correct. </li> <li> Ask your healthcare provider to repeat anything you do not understand. </li> <li> Partnership - you and your healthcare providers are partners in your treatment.  They can only help you if you let them know when you are having a problem. </li></ul></p><a name=\"4\"></a><h1>What should I know about my cancer and treatment?</h1><p>There are many kinds of information that you need:<ul> <li> An understanding of your diagnosis and stage of disease. </li> <li> Medications that are involved in your treatment. </li> <li> Side effects to expect from treatment. </li> <li> How to best keep track of treatment and side effects. </li> <li> How long you will be on treatment. </li> <li> How you might expect to respond to treatment. </li> <li> Risks and benefits of treatment. </li> <li> Other treatment that might be available. </li> <li> When you should call your doctor or nurse. </li> <li> Where you can go to get more information. </li> <li> Where you can get support. </li> <li> Understand that not all questions have answers. </li></ul></p><a name=\"5\"></a><h1>How do I call my healthcare provider?</h1><p>If you feel the situation is an emergency or urgent and you cannot get the information you need, call the healthcare provider or an emergency room. To do this, use the word \"emergency\" in your question, and then be persistent until you have the information you need.<br /><br />Here are some examples of phrasing you might use:<ul> <li> I have an emergency (or urgent need) and wish to talk to a doctor. </li> <li> I have a question about _______ and I\'m not sure if this is really an emergency. Who can help me? </li> <li> I\'m very concerned about _______. I think it is an emergency. </li></ul><b>There are five things you can do to improve your ability to get information you need. The following order is recommended. </b><ol> <li> Ask clear and specific questions. </li> <li> Know the name and contact information of the person that you need to reach. </li> <li> Learn who can answer your questions. </li> <li> Ask the questions yourself. </li> <li> Make a log or write questions down and bring to appointment. </li></ol>Other hints for good communication:<ul> <li> Learn which staff members give different kinds of information to people with cancer.

Even though you are the one coping with cancer, receiving medications, or having the surgery, your family, friends, and co-workers go through the treatments as well. Spouses or partners can sympathetically suffer the same nausea or pain. Children and parents face uncertainty and fear, and co-workers and friends have to deal with crises and interrupted schedules. Ask for help-everyone needs support. </p><br /><a name=\"2\"></a><h1>How can I effectively talk to my family and friends?</h1><p>You do not have to face the cancer alone. Call your friends, family, and anyone else who supports you. Even if you are coping well and able to function, the additional stress of the disease and its treatment puts a strain on the body. There are no disadvantages to having support in place in case you need it. Asking for help is a sign of strength and allows you to take control. If asking for help is difficult for you, practice saying the words in front of the mirror. This technique may make you feel more comfortable asking for what you want or need. </p><br /><a name=\"3\"></a><h1>What are some effective communication strategies?</h1><p>Here are some helpful tips to try when communicating with others:<ul> <li> Use \"I\" statements, such as \"I feel angry when...\", or \"I feel frustrated because...\", or \"I feel sad because...\". </li> <li> Clarify statements, such as \"Correct me if I heard you wrong, but I thought you said...\". </li> <li> Avoid using \"you\" statements, such as \"you always...\" or \"you never...\". </li> <li> Schedule time every day to talk. You can minimize interruptions by not answering the doorbell, turning off the ringer on the phone, and turning off the TV. </li> <li> Try to avoid serious discussion in the evening. This is when people are most likely to be tired and may not communicate clearly. </li> <li> Restate your message and explain its meaning if you think your message was not received correctly. </li> <li> Express your feelings and try to communicate openly. </li> <li> Know what you want from people.  Set priorities before asking for help. </li> <li> Make a list. </li></ul><p>Here are some suggestions on what you could ask for:</p><ul> <li> Please help me with my shopping. </li> <li> I need a hug. </li> <li> I would like you to help my family by inviting them out and taking them places. I may be sick, but they are suffering too. </li> <li> I might need transportation to treatment, to my doctor\'s office, or the store. </li> <li> I\'d love it if you\'d water my flowers! </li> <li> Please pray for me. </li> <li> Talk to me about the future; hope is important to me. </li> <li> I would love a call when you have a minute to just talk. </li> <li> I enjoy getting mail or email. </li> <li> Could you help me with chores? I still have dirty dishes, clothes and a house that needs cleaning. </li> <li> Bring a positive attitude, it\'s catching. </li> <li> Please help me feel good about myself. </li> <li> Can you take my children or me somewhere? Be specific. </li> <li> Offer to walk or feed my pet. </li> <li> I\'d like you to just listen to me. </li> <li> Appoint one of your friends or family to organize everyone else. You may not have to identify needs-they may do it for you. </li> <li> Ask someone to do the computer or literature search on your diagnosis and treatment and then sort out what is good. </li> <li> Make me laugh, tell me jokes, or read me funny stories. Cancer has not taken away my sense of humor. </li> <li> Talk to me about my concerns for dying and how the cancer has changed me, without thinking I have a negative attitude. </li></ul></p><a name=\"4\"></a><h1>What can family members and friends do to help me communicate more effectively?</h1><p>Ask family members and friends to:<ul> <li> Encourage you to tell them what you need. </li> <li> Tell you when they think you are not being clear in telling them what you need. </li></ul></p><a name=\"5\"></a><h1>How can I talk with my family members and friends about communicating more effectively?</h1><p>Here are some suggestions on how to talk to your family about effective communication:<ul> <li> Be open and honest with your family members and friends about how you feel. </li> <li> Ask your family what they think is causing the breakdown in communication. What may help you to communicate more effectively? </li></ul></p><a name=\"6\"></a><h1>When should I ask for help?</h1><p>It is never too early to ask for help.

People may not know how to talk with you about your cancer or cancer treatment.  The first time that this happens, you may be surprised or shocked.  You can use this experience to learn how to handle these kinds of situations in the future. Constructive ways to deal with inappropriate questions or comments are to:<ul> <li> Ignore it, particularly when it is painful. </li> <li> Answer questions in an evasive or general way. </li> <li> Tell them that the question or comment hurt your feelings.  As is often the case, you may hear similar questions or comments time and time again.  Feeling hurt and angry by these questions or comments is okay. </li></ul><h4>Here are some tips that may be helpful:</h4><ul> <li> Be straightforward and honest at whatever level feels comfortable to you. You can share as much or as little as you want. </li> <li> Save the personal information for people who are close to you. </li> <li> Decide in advance who gets what level of information about you, your cancer, and treatment. </li> <li> When people touch you and say, \"How are you really feeling?\", you may want to respond by saying how you truly feel (if they are someone close to you). </li> <li> Say you feel \"fine\" or \"okay\" (if they are someone who is a casual acquaintance). Be honest if you want help. </li> <li> Be prepared to encounter people that are uncomfortable being around you.  They may try to avoid you or talking to you. Realize that you can\'t count on them. </li> <li> Do not overlook someone you may not know well who is ready to be genuinely helpful. </li></ul></p><a name=\"7\"></a><h1>Where can I get more information?</h1><p>For more information, contact the people or organizations at the numbers or websites listed below:<ul> <li> Contact your healthcare provider. </li> <li> American Cancer Society: 1-800-ACS-2345 or <a href=http://www.cancer.org target=_blank>http://www.cancer.org</a> Click on patients, family & friends.

Again, ask your doctor\'s advice in this.</li>\n	<li>Consider doing yoga or mind/body exercises like Qigong (breathing exercises) or Tai Chi.</li>\n	<li>Do sitting exercises that include moving your joints and lifting light weights. These are especially helpful if you feel that you cannot handle a great deal of physical activity.</li>\n	<li>If you can, simply spend time outside. You can do gardening or yard work, talk to your neighbors, watch your children, or walk in the park.</li>\n	</ul>\n</li>\n\n<li><b>Be cautious...</b>\n	<ul>\n	<li>...if you have severe anemia (low red-blood cell count).

Always keep your head elevated. Rest in a chair after eating, and get plenty of rest in general.</li>\n<li>The aftertaste of food can add to your nausea. Brush your teeth after meals and use mouthwashes that do not contain alcohol to improve the taste in your mouth.</li>\n<li>You should try and be as comfortable as possible.

Make sure there is fresh air around the house by turning on a fan or keeping a window open.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nutrition:<br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drink 8 glasses of water per day (a total of about half a gallon).

Focus on eating slowly instead.</li>\n<li>Many people find that they have an easier time eating early in the day.

Keep a night light in your room and along the path you walk if you get up during the night.</li>\n<li>Arrange your furniture so that you have a clear pathway. Remove clutter or unnecessary rugs from the floor to prevent falls.</li>\n<li>Use soap dispensers instead of soap bars that can easily slip out of your hands. If you are having trouble feeling changes in temperature, use a non-breakable water thermometer to check your bath or dishwater temperature before you bathe or wash dishes to make sure that the water is no hotter than 100&#176;F (43.3&#176;C).

The good news is that today there are more than 10 million cancer survivors. We are fortunate for scientific advances in the prevention, detection, and treatment of cancer, but so much information and research can be hard to understand. We have designed this Web site to help answer your questions about cancer whether you or a family member have just been diagnosed with cancer or you want to learn about how to reduce your chance of getting cancer. \nThis site is a collaboration between the Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, Walther Cancer Foundation, and the Indiana University schools of nursing, informatics, and medicine. ...more  '),
(100100204, 'About the Portal', 'About The Portal Dr. Harold Burdette The late Dr. Harold Burdette devoted his life to the practice of medicine with a special focus on cancer. He began a collaboration with Dr. Joseph Walther in 1948 when they joined forces to start the Memorial Clinic, which was located in Indianapolis. He was appointed to the board of directors of the Walther Cancer Institute (now known as the Walther Cancer Foundation) in 1990 and established the Burdette-Kunkel endowment for direct support of research contributing to a greater understanding of how patients and their families respond to the physical and emotional effects of cancer and its treatment. His practice of medicine and support of behavioral research was a direct result of a core belief that a patient\'s environment, behaviors, and family play a major role in health outcomes. Dr. Burdette\'s support of oncology research was also based on his belief that prevention and early detection are the cornerstones in our fight against cancer morbidity and mortality. The majority of research now taking place in the Cancer Control and Prevention Program of the Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center was directly supported through endowment funds from the Mary Margaret Walther research program of the Walther Cancer Institute in Indianapolis. Dr. Burdette was the major leader and board supporter of developing and sustaining this important effort.\n The Burdette Cancer Portal is a site dedicated to providing information and education about cancer to everyone, and especially to those impacted by cancer, either as a cancer patient, a caregiver for a cancer patient, or a loved one of a cancer patient. Much of the inspiration for the Burdette Cancer Portal has come from the Mary Margaret Walther Program for Cancer Care Research of the IU School of Nursing.  The Program is formed around behavioral research in the following areas: Prevention and early detection of cancer Management of symptoms and side effects of cancer treatment at diagnosis Long-term survivorship issues Problems patients and families face with advanced cancer Scientists and researchers connected to the Walther Program formed the Behavioral Cooperative Oncology Group (BCOG)/Center for Symptom Management.  The BCOG group fosters collaboration among researchers and health care practitioners in the Midwest region.  BCOG\'s work in the field of symptom management research is the basis for much of the information you will find in the symptom management section of this site. The Burdette Cancer Portal is an effort to take the findings of the BCOG group and provide a platform to foster development and translation of symptom management research to cancer patients and their families.  It is hoped that the information provided by the portal will be accessible to as many people as possible, and that the the ways people find and use the information will provide useful insights into how best to make on-line resources available for cancer patients, caregivers, survivors, and families.

The program is interactive, with the video program pausing from time to time to allow participants to respond to questions posed by the talk show host. The program and the questions are designed to help women assess their risk for breast and colorectal cancers, and to encourage them to get cancer screenings. Mammograms Save Lives: Decide Today Mammograms Save Lives: Decide Today  is a program that explores the importance of getting regularly checked for breast cancer.  The program highlights how several different women have found ways to get regular mammograms. The program is provided on an interactive DVD, playable on a television or a computer, with opportunities for viewers to provide input to questions, and video material tailored for the viewer\'s responses. Pathways For Caring  Pathways For Caring is a research intervention designed to connect cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy with their caregivers.  Pairs of patients and caregivers were recruited for the study and asked to complete an 8-week program of symptom reporting for patients, and caregiver concern reporting for caregivers.  The program also involved information for both the patient and caregiver, as well as evaluation questionnaires to assess the usefulness of the information presented each week. Help For Cancer Caregivers Help For Cancer Caregivers  is a publicly available website, based on the caregiver resources developed for Pathways For Caring.  Caregivers provide information about their concerns, and information is provided for their priority interests.  The project is a collaboration between IU School of Nursing, IU School of Informatics, CancerCare.org, and Caregiver Action Network.  Funding was provided by Wellpoint Foundation.\n Escape From Nicotinia Escape From Nicotinia is a video game project designed to prevent smoking for young girls.  Done in the style of a graphic novel, the game uses a story line that follows a young girl who must make choices to avoid being trapped in Nicotinia, a dreary city with ash-tray architecture, and creepy characters who think they are \"cool\".

The life cycle of each of your cells is controlled by its genes.  Cancer is caused by changes (or mutations) in a cell\'s genes.  Researchers have learned that mutations in genes can be caused by  risk factors , such as lifestyle or the environment.   It is common for cancers to be named for the part of the body or type of cell where they began.  Cancers normally start out small and in one part of the body.  The cancer cells can break away (or metastasize) from the first (or primary) site of  diagnosis .  The metastasized cancer cells can enter the bloodstream, spreading to other areas of the body and form new tumors.  The new tumors and primary tumor have the same name because they are made of the same kind of abnormal cells.  The best time to find (or detect) and diagnose cancer is in the early stage of its growth.  Learn about cancer\'s  early warning signs .  Not all cancers have early warning signs.  Regularly check your body for any changes.  If you are concerned, schedule an appointment with your doctor.  Having regular check-ups and screenings help your doctor to monitor any irregular changes in your body.  If you are diagnosed with cancer, the treatment will depend on the type and stage of the cancer. You and your care team will decide what the best comprehensive  treatment  plan is for you.  '),

(American Cancer Society) Staying Active (American Cancer Society) Common Questions About Diet and Cancer  (American Cancer Society) Tobacco and Cancer (American Cancer Society) Smoking and Cancer (National Cancer Institute) Scientists at the IU Simon Cancer Center are currently trying to find out what factors can contribute to a person\'s chance of developing cancer. Some factors can be avoided, such as smoking cigarettes. Other factors, like those that are inherited, are unavoidable.  Factors are divided into two types, protective and risk.   Protective factors decrease a person\'s chance of developing cancer.  Risk factors increase the chance of developing cancer. Prevention means increasing the protective factors and avoiding the known risk factors that can be controlled so that the chance of developing cancer decreases. Current cancer prevention recommendations may be specific to different types of cancer and include:  Quit tobacco use.  Make healthy, nutrient-rich food choices. Examples of healthy choices are high fiber foods, whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and foods low in animal fat.  Limit alcohol to less than one drink per day.  Wear protective clothing, a hat, and sunscreen with at least a sun protective factor (SPF) of 12.  Reduce mid-day UV radiation exposure during the hours of 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.  Follow work and safety rules to avoid or minimize contact with dangerous materials.  Discuss the risks and benefits of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with your doctor before beginning therapy.  Possible risk factors for cancer are a mix of lifestyle, hereditary, and environmental factors and include:  Tobacco and alcohol use. High-fat diet. Being overweight. Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. Exposure to cancer-causing agents or carcinogens in the environment and workplace, such as ionizing radiation and other chemicals, metals, or pesticides. Exposure to hormones through medical regimens, such as hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Being infected with certain viruses (although cancer is not contagious). Close relatives with certain types of cancer that tend to occur more often in some families than the rest of the population. It is important to remember that increasing protective factors and avoiding risk factors does not guarantee that you will not get cancer. Most people with a particular risk factor for cancer do not actually get the cancer.  For as yet unknown reasons, some people are more sensitive than others to factors that can cause cancer.  Talk to your doctor about regular check-ups and methods of increasing protective factors and decreasing risk factors for cancer that might be effective for you.  '),

Your doctor may then order various tests and exams that, if positive, may diagnose or detect cancer. Laboratory tests  examine a sample of blood, urine, or other substance from the body.  Imaging tests  produce pictures of areas inside the body.  Biopsies  surgically remove some portion of the tumor to examine under the microscope.  If cancer is diagnosed, the doctor will want to learn the stage or extent of disease that will indicate whether or not the disease has spread or metastasized to other parts of the body. To do so, your doctor may order further tests or biopsies.  '),

A treatment plan should be developed based on several factors:  type of cancer, stage or how much it has spread, location, and the general health of the patient.   Patients and families often ask about the prognosis (the likely outcome or course of disease).  It is important to understand that the prognosis is only a prediction based on statistics.  No two patients are alike.  Patient responses to treatment will vary because of many factors, such as stage, age, and general health.  It is important to talk about treatment options with your doctor so that you make an informed treatment decision together.  Most of the time, the best treatment plan is a combination of options.  The following is a list of possible treatment options:  Surgery Chemotherapy Radiation therapy Bone marrow or stem cell transplantation Biological therapy Hormone therapy Surgery Surgery is an operation to remove the cancer.  Sometimes the surrounding tissue or lymph nodes are also removed if the cancer has spread.  Surgery  (American Cancer Society) Chemotherapy Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill the cancer.  How the drug is given will vary based on the kind of therapy.  Drugs are most often given intravenously (IV) into a vein.  Sometimes the drugs are given by injection into a muscle or under the skin, or as a pill and taken by mouth. Chemotherapy may be given alone, along with other types of therapy, or to relieve symptoms of disease.  Generally, chemotherapy is given in cycles.  An example of a chemotherapy cycle is a treatment period followed by a recovery period.

The lungs are a pair of organs in the chest that supplies the body with oxygen, and removes carbon dioxide from the body.  More than one million people world-wide are diagnosed each year with lung cancer, including approximately 170,000 people in the United States.  Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer accounts for about 80 percent of all lung cancers. It is divided into different subtypes based on the cells the tumor develops from. These include adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma.  \r\n   Adenocarcinoma is the most common subtype and usually develops at the edges of the lungs. This is usually slow growing and is frequently found in nonsmokers and women.  \r\n   Squamous cell cancers are strongly associated with smoking and are usually found in the larger airways and toward the center of the chest.  \r\n   Large cell cancers account for the fewest number in the non-small cell cancer category. Multiple treatment modalities, such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, are available and are recommended according to the stage of your disease.  Small cell lung cancer is less common than non-small cell lung cancer and tends to be more aggressive and is more common in smokers. It is usually divided into two categories. Limited stage is frequently responsive to a combination treatment of systemic chemotherapy and radiation. Extensive stage is treated with systemic chemotherapy.

Mesothelioma is cancer of the pleural lining and is associated with asbestos exposure.  \r\n\r\n Thymoma Thymoma is a disease in which cancer cells are found in the thymus. The thymus is a small organ that lies under the breastbone. It makes white blood cells known as lymphocytes that travel throughout the body to fight infection. Thymoma is usually a slow growing tumor that does not spread beyond the thymus.

What can family members and friends do to help me with my lack of appetite? How can I talk with my family members and friends about my lack of appetite? What should I report to my healthcare provider about my lack of appetite?  What things should I discuss with my healthcare provider about my lack of appetite?  Where can I get more information? References Supportive evidence-based practice What is lack of appetite? A lack of or decreased appetite is when a person does not feeling hungry, even though they have not eaten enough to meet their basic caloric needs. If not treated and managed, it can lead to a more serious condition. Increasing your appetite, you can improve both your quality of life and ability to tolerate cancer treatments.  How do people describe lack of appetite? Lack of appetite can be described as not having the desire to eat.  Often, people with cancer or those undergoing cancer treatment report that they have no appetite, feel full quicker than usual, or both. What causes lack of appetite? Cancer itself can affect your appetite, food digestion, and energy level.  Many people report that their senses of taste and smell change because of their treatment. These changes can decrease appetite.  Some have experienced changes in appetite because of nausea, vomiting, or uncontrolled pain and fatigue.  Other factors that can contribute to appetite loss include medications, anxiety, depression or sadness, lack of sleep, difficulty swallowing, constipation, or diarrhea.  What can I do about lack of appetite? Not eating well can keep you from getting the nutrients that you need.  Here are some tips you might find helpful: ACTIVITY  Assess your nutritional status by keeping a log of the food that you eat.  Write down all of the food that you ate in a 24 hour period.   Freeze food in meal size portions.   Give food a chance.  Even though you have trouble eating now, you may find a time when eating is enjoyable.   Weigh yourself at the same time every day.   Stock up on favorite foods.   Keep a supply of foods that can be eaten during times of illness, such as popsicles, broths, or lemon-lime soda.   Do not eat your favorite foods on the day of your treatments or when you feel nauseated.  Your body may learn to associate these foods with nausea.   Eat foods that are cold or room temperature if food odors bother you.   Do not try to lose weight while being treated for cancer, unless directed by your healthcare provider to do so.   Do light exercises for 30 minutes before mealtime may help you to feel hungrier.  Examples of light exercises are walking around the block or around the house.  COMMUNICATION  Ask your nurse, dietician, or doctor to help you assess your nutritional status before and during your treatment.  DIET  Try new foods.  Tastes can change.  Different foods may be a pleasant addition to your menu.   Using sauces and gravies can make swallowing easier.   Drink 8 (8oz.) glasses of water or other non-caffeinated drinks every day.  Avoid caffeine (i.e. colas, coffee) when possible.  Caffeine can cause dehydration.   Eat calorie-rich foods such as malts, shakes, and omelets.   Try eating 5-6 smaller meals or snacks throughout the day.   Avoid carbonated beverages, they can make you feel full but do not add nutrition.   Get approval from your oncologist to try Boost or Ensure. These high-calorie supplements can also be mixed with fruit or ice cream to make a shake.  Supplements can be filling, so try to eat your meal before taking them.  NOTE:  Supplements can stay on your tongue and mouth.  Many find it helpful to sip through a straw and drink them cold.   Suck on hard candy if you have a metallic taste in your mouth.   Eat meats, fruits and vegetables in small portions throughout the day.  Avoid milk if its upsets your stomach.   Eat protein everyday (tuna fish, chicken, peanut butter, and cheese).   Treat constipation and diarrhea.  Both of them can affect your appetite. Use seasonings on foods that you are finding unpleasant.  Basil, oregano and rosemary can make meat, fish or poultry more flavorful.  MEDICATION  Take a daily vitamin supplement.   Take your prescribed anti-nausea medications 30-60 minutes before eating.   Ask your doctor if an appetite stimulant like Megace (a hormone that improves appetite and can help you increase your calorie intake) would be good for you.  INFORMATION FOR CAREGIVERS  Do not try to push your family member into eating or drinking.   Provide encouragement and support without being overwhelming.   Keep snacks and utensils within easy reach.   Plan on small, frequent meals.   Encourage fluids if your family member cannot eat. Many fluids are nutritious and contain calories. Your family member may not drink much at a time.  Even when sipped, juices and other fluids can be beneficial.   Be prepared for changing tastes. They may changes day-to-day.  Favorite foods may not taste good some days.   Have high-energy foods available.  What can family members and friends do to help me with my lack of appetite? Ask family members and friends to:  Keep foods around that require little or no preparation time.  Examples of easy to prepare foods include: cheese, eggs, pudding, peanut butter, or tuna fish.   Help with grocery shopping and cooking.   Make mealtime pleasant. This may include fresh flowers on the table or pleasant music while eating.  How can I talk with my family members and friends about my lack of appetite? Here are some ideas that may help you talk to family members and friends:  Tell your family members and friends how the lack of appetite is affecting your daily activities and emotions.   Ask your family members and friends for suggestions that might help.   Make suggestions about your food preferences.  What should I report to my healthcare provider about my lack of appetite? If you experience any of the following symptoms, report them to your healthcare provider:  Several days (3-5) of eating poorly.   Decreased amount of urine.   Dark colored urine.   Fever greater than 100.4 degrees Farenheit (38.0 C) for over 24 hours.   Dizziness.   Mental confusion.   Uncontrolled nausea or vomiting.   Inability to tolerate fluids for over 24 hours.   Loss of 5 pounds in a week or more than 2 pounds in 24 hours.   Nothing to eat or drink for 24 hours.   Constipation (no bowel movement for 2 days).   Pain.   Depression and/or anxiety.  What things should I discuss with my healthcare provider about my lack of appetite? If you are experiencing a lack of appetite, you should discuss the following with your healthcare provider at your next appointment:  Can you help me find ways to improve my diet, even though I lack an appetite?   How many calories should I consume each day?   How long will I continue to experience strange tastes in my mouth? What is causing this?   I am losing weight steadily.

References Supportive evidence-based practice What is constipation? Constipation is defined as a condition in which bowel (stool) movements are rare, incomplete, or there is difficulty in passing stool. No regular bowel movement for 3 days is described as constipation. Constipation is common for persons taking opioids (any medicine containing opium) and other medications for their pain. Constipation also occurs for those who have inadequate fluid or fiber intake, who have consistently low levels of physical activity, or as a result of the cancer process, chemotherapy or other drug therapies. How do people describe constipation? Many people have described constipation as feeling an enlargement or bloating in the abdomen, or a sense of fullness in the rectal area. Others describe small amounts of stool \"leaking\", small frequent \"smears\" of stool, or rectal pain with a bowel movement. Constantly feeling the need to have a bowel movement, but unable to pass stool, is another way to describe how constipation feels. What causes constipation? The cause of constipation varies. Pain medication and chemotherapy drugs can cause constipation. Constipation can be caused from the cancer itself.  Other causes include stress, fever, changes in diet, not drinking enough fluids, or low levels of physical activity. Constipation is common for those who spend a lot of time in bed, are not eating well, or are experiencing weakness. Don\'t think that constipation isn\'t important, will go away by its self, or is not worth treating. If constipation is not treated it is both very painful and dangerous to your health, and can lead to serious complications. What can I do about constipation? Here are some tips you may find helpful: ACTIVITY  Exercise every day, at least a 15-minute walk.  Perform mild exercise, such as walking.   Establish a daily bathroom routine that includes privacy.  Use the toilet after mealtime.   Have a quiet comfortable environment when having a bowel movement.   Avoid straining or pushing hard with bowel movements.  DIET  Drink 8 (8oz.) glasses of water or other non-caffeinated drinks every day.  Avoid caffeine (e.g., colas, coffee) when possible.  Caffeine can cause dehydration.   Add unprocessed bran or wheat germ to your diet.  Start with two teaspoons per day and gradually increase to two tablespoons per day.   Eat foods high in fibers, such as raw vegetables, popcorn, raisin bran, beans, whole grain cereal, raisins, and prunes.   Drink warm liquids, such as lemon water, prune juice, or herbal tea after mealtime.  MEDICATIONS  Do not use suppositories or enemas without talking to your healthcare provider.   Ask your healthcare providers for a stool softener and/or laxative.   Ask your doctor for a laxative if you take a narcotic for pain. Pain medications with narcotics often cause constipation.  COMMUNICATION  Let your doctor or nurse know if you have hemorrhoids or tears in the skin around the rectum.  What can family and friends do to help me with my constipation? Ask family members and friends to:  Prepare foods high in fiber.   Offer you fluids throughout the day.   Exercise with you.   Help keep a log or record of bowel movements, bloating, gas or abdominal pain. Record what you eat, drink, and any medication that you are taking.  How can I talk with my family members and friends about my constipation? Here are some ideas that may help you talk to family members and friends:  Describe how being constipated makes you feel.  What should I report to my healthcare provider about my constipation? If you experience any of the following symptoms, report them to your healthcare provider:  No bowel movement for 3-4 days.   Vomiting or abdominal bloating accompanied by constipation that lasts over 24 hours.   Inability to eat.   Bloody, black, or tarry stools.   Severe uncontrolled abdominal pain.   Painful bowel function.   Impaction-hardened stool that does not come out.   Increased or decreased urge to urinate.   Back pain.   No bowel movement within 24 hours after starting a laxative.   Have your log or record available with the following information:   Your normal bowel pattern. Date and time of last bowel movement. How much food and fluids you have taken in the last 1-2 days. Medications you have taken in the last 2-3 days. Any over-the-counter products that you may have already tried. Any history of past bowel problems or surgeries. What things should I discuss with my healthcare provider about my constipation? If you are experiencing constipation, you should discuss the following with your healthcare provider at your next visit:  Does my chemotherapy or nausea medication cause constipation?   Is it safe to use over-the-counter products? Do you have suggestions what I should use?   What type of exercise would you recommend for me?   Do you recommend that I use fiber supplements?

(100300101804, 'Diarrhea', 'Diarrhea What is diarrhea? How do people describe diarrhea? What causes diarrhea? What can I do about diarrhea? What can family members and friends do to help me with my diarrhea? How can I talk to my family members and friends about my diarrhea? What should I report to my healthcare provider about my diarrhea? What things should I discuss with my healthcare provider?  Where can I get more information? References Supportive evidence-based practice What is diarrhea? Diarrhea is defined as three or more loose or watery stools (bowel movements) per day. Stool is what is left after your digestive system (stomach, small intestine, and colon) absorbs nutrients and fluid from what you eat and drink. When fluid is not absorbed or if your digestive system produces extra fluid, stools will be loose and watery. Loose stools are larger than usual, and people with diarrhea may pass more than a quart of watery stool a day. Severe or untreated diarrhea can lead to dehydration, which means the body does not have enough fluid to function properly. If left untreated diarrhea may cause dizziness, fainting, weight loss, dry skin, and weakness. Replacing fluids is the primary treatment for diarrhea. How do people describe diarrhea? People who have diarrhea may also have abdominal pain with cramping, bloating, and nausea. It is often described as having an urgent need to have a bowel movement and an inability to control it. People usually use the terms \"loose\" and \"watery\" stools, and report the number of times they have to use the bathroom within a period of time. Diarrhea can be mild (3 stools per day) to severe (12 or more stools per day). As a result, skin irritation and soreness around the rectum can occur. What causes diarrhea? Diarrhea can be caused by chemotherapy or radiation treatments to the abdomen, pelvis, or rectum. Treatments for cancer can interfere with normal bowel function, increase bowel activity, or by irritate the lining of the bowel. Loose or watery stools can start shortly after receiving treatment or up to two weeks later.  Other common causes of diarrhea include: antibiotics, infections, reactions to foods, or laxatives taken to prevent constipation. What can I do about diarrhea? Here are some tips you may find helpful: ACTIVITY  Keep track of the number of stools you have within a 24 hour-period.  Also, record any cramping or gas pains in a diary.   Diarrhea can cause pain and soreness to the skin around the rectum.  Clean the area often with unscented baby oil or baby wipes.  The aloe in baby wipes can be very soothing.  Use the wipes instead of toilet paper to gently wipe the rectal area.  Take warm baths or sitz baths 3-4 times a day.  Sit in the warm water for about 10 minutes.  Use Desitin&#174; or A&D&#174; ointment on the skin after each bowel movement.  COMMUNICATION  Contact your doctor or nurse to prescribe something for your diarrhea if over-the counter-medications do not work.  DIET  Try eating smaller, more frequent meals or snacks.   Try eating foods such as: bananas, rice or oats, applesauce, smooth peanut butter, graham crackers, dry toast, crackers, plain pasta, eggs, poultry or baked potatoes.   Avoid eating food that is high in fiber, fatty, or spicy.  Try not to eat rich desserts.  Examples of foods that can increase bowels movements or gas include: beans, raw vegetables, corn, cauliflower, broccoli, and hot peppers.   Do not drink alcoholic beverages.   Follow a low fiber/ low roughage diet.  Do not eat wheat and bran.   Drink 8 (8oz.) glasses of water or other non-caffeinated drinks every day.  Avoid caffeine (e.g., colas, coffee) when possible.  Caffeine can cause dehydration.   Replace lost fluids with nonfat broth, soup, orange juice, Pedialyte&#174; or sports drinks like Gatorade&#174;.   When having diarrhea, drink less fluid with your meals.  Drink more fluid between meals and avoid hot liquids.   Avoid nuts and dried fruits.   Avoid milk products (including ice cream and cheese) until diarrhea subsides.  MEDICATIONS  Talk to your doctor or nurse about taking over-the-counter medications, such as Imodium&#174; AD, Kaopectate&#174;, Pepto-Bismol&#174; or Maalox&#174; antidiarrheal caplets (loperamide).   Talk to your doctor or nurse before using any creams or ointments if you are receiving radiation treatments to the abdomen, pelvis, or rectal area.  What can family members and friends do to help me with my diarrhea? Ask family members and friends to:  Buy food that can help decrease diarrhea.  Food items are listed above.   Remind you to take your over-the-counter medicines as directed by your healthcare provider.   Prepare low fiber meals.   Offer you fluids and broth throughout the day.   Assist in locating restrooms when outside your normal environment.   Help with keeping a log or record of your bowel movements and symptoms. This log or record will help your medical team better understand and treat your diarrhea. Try to log the number of stools, time of day, whether stools were formed or watery, any cramping you experienced, and your daily weight.  Also record if any medication was taken and fluid intake.  How can I talk to my family members and friends about my diarrhea? Here are some ideas that may help you talk to family members and friends:  Request privacy to discuss your concerns.   Try to describe how the diarrhea makes you feel and express your concerns.   Tell them if you are having any symptoms listed below.  What should I report to my healthcare provider about my diarrhea? If you experience any of the following symptoms, report them to your healthcare provider:  Skin around the rectum that is open, sore, or tender.   Spike a fever of 100.4  (38.0 C) associated with diarrhea.   Bloody or black tarry looking stools.   Unable to eat or drink for more than 24 hours.   Diarrhea that continues for more than 3 days.   Being thirsty.   Feeling tired or dizzy.   Fainting.   Weakness.   Urinating less often than usual.   Having dark yellow colored urine.   Severe abdominal cramps or pain.   Heart palpations (heart racing when you are at rest).   Have your log or record available with the following information:   Your normal bowel pattern. Color, consistency, and number of stools in the last 24 hours. How much food and fluid you have taken in the last 1-2 days. Medicines that you have taken in the last 2-3 days. Any history of past bowel problems. If you are being treated with radiation therapy to the pelvis, abdomen, or rectum. Weight loss. What things should I discuss with my healthcare provider? If you are experiencing diarrhea, you should discuss the following with your healthcare provider at your next appointment:  Does my chemotherapy medication cause diarrhea? If so, how is it usually controlled?   Will my radiation/chemotherapy cause me to have diarrhea?   How long does the diarrhea usually last?   Do I need to be on a low fiber diet?   When do you want me to notify you if I develop diarrhea?  Where can I get more information?

What can family members and friends do to help me with my fatigue? How can I talk with family members and friends about my fatigue? What should I report to my healthcare provider?  What things should I discuss with my healthcare provider? Where can I get more information? References Supportive evidence-based practice What is fatigue? Fatigue is an overwhelming sense of exhaustion. It is a decreased ability to do physical and mental work, regardless of enough sleep. People have less energy to do the things that they normally do. Fatigue is one of the most common side effects of cancer treatment, regardless of whether the treatment is radiation, or chemotherapy. It is more severe and distressing than everyday fatigue. Fatigue that is caused by cancer treatments can exist beyond the end of treatment.  How do people describe fatigue? Those who experience fatigue often report having no energy for usual daily activities. Some say that their arms and legs feel heavy.  Others describe fatigue as feeling tired, weak, exhausted, worn-out, slow, or unable to concentrate. Rest does not always relieve it. People sometimes have feelings of sadness, irritability, or frustration.  They may tire easily even after napping or getting a good night\'s sleep.  What causes fatigue? Fatigue can result from cancer therapy, emotional stress, spending too much time in bed, or from not getting enough exercise.  It can be caused by anemia (low red blood cell count), infections, poor nutrition, and pain.  It is very important that you discuss fatigue with your healthcare provider. Fatigue can affect your quality of life, mood, relationships, job performance, and can even interfere with your treatment.  What can I do about fatigue? It may not be possible to prevent fatigue caused by cancer and its treatment. However, you can take steps to help manage this side effect.  Here are some tips you might find helpful:  ACTIVITY  Take short naps (30-45 minutes) in the late morning or early afternoon.   Avoid long periods of bed rest.   Manage other side effects that can make fatigue worse such as pain, anemia, sleep problems, infections, and emotional stress.   Exercise every day.  Talk to your healthcare provider about what exercises are right for you.   Conserve your energy.  Plan your activities around times when you usually have the most energy.   Set priorities for your activities.   Delegate activities to other people that you do not need to do yourself.

Seeing a nutritionist for recommendations on nutritional supplements. Educational information about fatigue. DIET  Eat a diet with fresh fruits and vegetables, and lean meat/fish/chicken, and milk products (as recommended by your healthcare provider).  You need to eat for energy and good nutrition.  MEDICATION  Ask your healthcare provider if psychostimulants or antidepressants are right for you. These medications are prescribed by doctors. They can improve your mood, energy levels, and outlook on life.  PSYCHOLOGICAL  Consider learning relaxation therapy, guided imagery and meditation.   Join a support group. Support groups can provide suggestions and reassurance in a safe environment.  You can share similar concerns with other people experiencing fatigue.  What can family members and friends do to help me with my fatigue? Ask family members and friends to:  Help you with housework, chores, yard work or cooking.   Take a walk with you and encourage you to walk every day.   Offer you fluids throughout the day to increase your fluid intake.   Help you set daily priorities.

What can family members and friends do to help me with my mouth sores? How can I talk to my family and friends about my mouth sores? What should I report to my healthcare provider about my mouth sores? What things should I discuss with my healthcare provider about my mouth sores? Where can I get more information? References Supportive evidence-based practice What are mouth sores? Mucositis is when the mucus lining of the mouth and tongue and throat become reddened, swollen and painful. Open sores called ulcers can develop. About half of cancer patients on chemotherapy and almost all who have radiation to the head or neck will experience mouth discomfort as a side effect of treatment. The discomfort can range from mild to severe. Mild discomfort is a change in the way the mouth feels. It is easily treated and quick to heal. Moderate discomfort is considered to be redness and open sores in the mouth. Severe mucositis involves many sores in the mouth, bleeding, and severe pain. None of these discomfort levels are pleasant. Each can cause other problems including difficulty swallowing, talking, eating, and infection. There are preventive steps and treatment that you can do to minimize this uncomfortable side effect.  It is very important that any discomfort in your mouth is reported to your doctor or nurse immediately. Early reporting is the best way to decrease the severity and prevent further complications. Mucositis can delay your cancer treatment or limit the dose of your therapy. How do people describe mouth sores? After about three to five days of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, the lining of the mouth may feel a little warm. There may be some tingling or minor soreness. Within one to two weeks of starting your treatment, sores may begin to appear. A week or two after your treatment is finished the sores begin to heal.  Usually after the third week out of treatment, the ulcers and pain will have disappeared.  There are a number of warning signs that commonly describe mucositis, including:  Burning or tingling feeling inside the mouth.   Inside of the mouth looks red, shiny, and swollen.   Red, inflamed patches. These may include white spots.   Raw feeling in the throat.   Unusual mouth dryness.   Open sores or ulcers in the mouth or under the tongue.   Thick secretions or saliva.   Blood in the mouth or saliva.   Pain in the mouth.  What causes mouth sores? Chemotherapy and radiation therapy work on rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells.  They also attack other cells in the body, including those forming the lining of the mouth and throat. As mouth cells die from the treatment, open sores can develop.  Gradually, normal cells in the mouth start to grow again and the sores heal.  Individual risk factors for developing mouth sores include:   Advanced age.   Poor nutritional status.   Poor oral hygiene.   Poor fitting dentures.   Tobacco use (cigarettes, cigars, or pipes).   Drink alcohol beverages (beer, wine, or liquor).  Treatment related risk factors include:  Drug dosage.   Treatment schedule.   Receiving radiation therapy.  A large number of chemotherapy drugs can cause mouth sores. It is most commonly reported with:  5- fluoroucil (5-FU)   Cisplatin&#174;   Etoposide&#174;   Methotrexate&#174;   Cytarabine&#174;   Bleomycin&#174;   Cyclophosphamide&#174;   Dactinomycin&#174;   Paclitaxel&#174;   High doses of chemotherapy  What can I do about mouth sores? Proper mouth care on a frequent, daily basis plays an important role in oral health during cancer therapy. You may not be able to prevent all problems, but it will decrease the severity of the problems, especially with certain chemotherapy treatments and/or radiation therapy. ACTIVITY  Schedule a complete dental examination before you begin your chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment.  Inform your dentist that you will be undergoing cancer treatment.   Take care of your mouth and keep it clean.  That means careful brushing and flossing based on discussion with your doctor and/or dentist.   Use the softest bristle brush available or an oral sponge.  (Rinsing the bristles in hot water can even make them softer).   Brush your teeth after every meal and at bedtime using nonabrasive toothpaste with no strong whiteners, which may cause irritation. Brush all tooth surfaces for at least 90 seconds.   Brush your tongue as well as teeth and gums to help reduce the risk of fungal infections.   Change your toothbrush frequently --every week or so.   Do not use special appliances, such as water piks and electric toothbrushes. They may further irritate sensitive mouth tissue and gums.   Floss gently everyday with unwaxed dental floss.  Stop flossing if you experience any bleeding or low blood counts.   Clean dentures after every meal.  If possible, avoid wearing dentures overnight while asleep.   Make sure your dentures fit properly. Repair or replace them if they do not fit well.  Poor fitting dentures can rub and cause additional pain in a tender mouth.   Avoid using mouth rinse products that have glycerin or alcohol as they can cause dying in your mouth.   Rinse mouth frequently (every 2 hours while awake & when awake during the night).  Mouth solution:   1/2 teaspoon salt 2 teaspoons baking soda 4 cups (1 quart) of plain water Shake or stir the solution.  Keep it with you for regular use.  If you make more than a one-day supply, keep the remainder in the refrigerator. COMMUNICATION  Check with your healthcare provider to make sure it is safe to wear your dentures if you are receiving radiation treatments to the head and neck area.   Talk to your healthcare provider if you need additional suggestions or continue to lose weight during your treatment.  Many practices have dieticians available for advice.   Ask your doctor if you can take Tylenol&#174; or ibuprofen&#174; for pain relief.   Ask your healthcare provider if there is a specific medication that can help fight infections.  Chemotherapy and radiation can weaken the immune system.  Bacteria that live in the mouth can cause infections in mouth sores.  DIET  Drink at least 8-10 glasses of non-carbonated liquids each day.   Suck on non-irritating hard candy (sugar-free is best). Chewing gum may help.   Eat popsicles or suck ice cubes for moisture.   Avoid very hot food.  If your mouth is tender, try eating most of your food warm or at room temperature.   Avoid highly seasoned food, which can aggravate mouth soreness.   Avoid alcohol and tobacco.  Both irritate an already-sore mouth and throat.   Restrict the amount of citrus fruit, tomatoes, and salty food in your diet. They can be uncomfortable for some people with mouth sores.   Grind up or puree food in a blender. Foods with shape edges, such as chips and cracker, may be irritating.   Use sauces or gravies to make foods easier for you to swallow and chew.   Small, frequent meals may also be easier for you to eat.   Drink liquid supplements to maintain your calorie intake. Examples of supplements are  Carnation&#174; Instant Breakfast&#174;, Ensure&#174;, and Boost&#174;.   Choose to eat soft and soothing foods. Examples include: ice cream, milkshakes, baby foods, mashed potatoes, scrambled eggs, cottage cheese, custards, puddings, and gelatin.  MEDICATION  Try artificial saliva, such as Oral Balance&#174;, Moist Plus&#174;, and Salivant&#174;. This can be purchased at a drugstore without a prescription.   Keep your lips moist with lip balm, Chapstick&#174;, or petroleum jelly.   Use a water-based mouth moisturizer to help keep the mouth moist. An example of a moisturizer is Biotene&#174; Oral Lubricant.)   Do not use liquid medications containing alcohol, such as cough medications. They may irritate the mouth.   Take stronger drugs for severe pain. Pain causes stress, depression, and fatigue. Opiates are a class of strong drugs, one of which is morphine, that provide effective pain relief. It is very important to talk to your doctor or nurse if your pain is not being controlled. Many opiates are also available in liquids and patches if you are not able to swallow pills.   Treat discomfort/pain:   Use topical or local agents such as Orajel&#174;, Anbesol&#174;, Zilactin-b&#174;, or Orabase&#174;, which are available in the drugstore. A combination mouthwash with a local anesthetic can be prescribed from your healthcare provider. Take 2 teaspoons every 2-4 hours or prior to meals to alleviate mild discomfort. Gelclair&#174; is a prescription medication available to sooth the oral pain from sores. Ask your doctor if you can take Tylenol&#174; or ibuprofen&#174; for pain relief.  Severe pain:   Do not resist taking stronger drugs for severe pain. Pain causes stress, depression, and fatigue. Opiates&#174;, a class of drug that includes morphine, are used for pain relief. It is very important to talk to your healthcare provider if your pain is not being controlled. Many opiates are also available in liquids and patches if you are not able to swallow pills.  Fight infections:   Chemotherapy and radiation can weaken the immune system.  Bacteria that live in the mouth can cause infections in mouth sores. Your healthcare provider may order specific medications to help fight infections. What can family members and friends do to help me with my mouth sores? Ask family members and friends to:   Prepare meals high in protein to promote healing.   Remind you to perform mouth care after meals and at bedtime.   Prepare bland, soft foods that will be more tolerable.   Help buy or prepare mouth care solutions, toothpaste and lip balm.  How can I talk to my family and friends about my mouth sores? Here are some ideas that may help you talk to family members and friends:  Be open with your family members about how you feel having mouth sores.   Ask them for ideas on how to deal with your mouth sores.   Tell your family members how your mouth sores are affecting your emotions.   Ask your family members how your mouth sores are affecting them.  What should I report to my healthcare provider about my mouth sores? If you experience any of the following symptoms, report them to your healthcare provider:  New red or white patches your mouth or tongue.   New sores in your mouth or tongue.   Weight loss of more than 5 pounds in one week.   Inability to eat any food for 24 hours.   Pain that is not relieved.   Bleeding from gums or mouth sores.   Pain with swallowing or sore throat that interferes with eating, drinking, or sleeping.   Fever.   Pain or signs of infection (tongue heavily coated).  What things should I discuss with my healthcare provider about my mouth sores? If you are experiencing mouth sores, you should discuss the following with your healthcare provider at your next appointment:  Is it likely that my cancer treatment will cause mouth sores?   Specifically, how should I manage my mouth care on a daily basis?   Is there a dietician available to help guide me in choosing appropriate foods?   Will the mouth sores interfere with the schedule of my cancer treatment?   What medications can I use for pain and how often should I use them?   What are the warning signs of infection, and what should I do if my mouth becomes infected?  Where can I get more information?

What can family members and friends do to help with my nausea? How can I talk to my family and friends about nausea? What should I report to my healthcare provider about my nausea? What things should I discuss with my healthcare provider about my nausea?  Where can I get more information? References Supportive evidence-based practice What is nausea? Nausea is an unpleasant feeling in the back of the throat and stomach that could result in vomiting. Feeling nauseous can be worse than vomiting. Nausea and vomiting that does not go away can cause dehydration (loss of fluids), loss of appetite, imbalance of vitamin and minerals, weakness, difficulty concentrating and poor quality of life.  Two of the side effects that people find most concerning while undergoing cancer treatment are nausea and vomiting. Controlling these side effects is a very important part of your treatment. There are many medications and therapies that can effectively control nausea and vomiting.  Report your symptoms to your healthcare provider so that the right treatment can be found for you. How do people describe nausea? People describe nausea as an unpleasant feeling related to food, smells or situations, such as cancer treatment. With this feeling, there may be a biter (or acidic) taste in the mouth or abdominal fullness while eating.  Some people who feel nauseous describe it as, \"sick to my stomach\", \"queasy\", or \"butterflies\". Nausea may cause increased saliva, lightheadedness, dizziness, difficulty swallowing, skin temperature changes, fast heart rate and lack of appetite.  What causes nausea? Nausea is caused when certain parts of the intestinal tract or specific areas of the brain become stimulated.  Chemotherapy and radiation treatments can cause a person with cancer to have nausea and vomiting. Chemotherapy All chemotherapies are different. Some can cause more nausea and vomiting than others. There are different types of chemotherapy related nausea and vomiting:   Acute- occurs a few minutes to hours after chemotherapy is given and goes away within the first 24 hours.   Delayed- develops more than 24 hours after the chemotherapy is given and can last 6-7 days.   Anticipatory- learned from previous experiences with vomiting. It occurs as a result of an unpleasant experience with chemotherapy.   Breakthrough- occurs despite treatment to prevent it.   Refractory- occurs after a few chemotherapy treatments even though the person is being treated for nausea.  Radiation The chance of nausea and vomiting is greater when the area being radiated is the brain or the abdomen, specifically the small intestine (or small bowel). The symptoms can occur 1-2 hours after treatment and can last for several hours.  Other causes of nausea are:  The cancer itself can cause nausea and vomiting, especially with gastrointestinal tumors and brain cancer.   Use of pain medications (narcotics) and antidepressants.   Constipation and bowel obstruction.   Anxiety.   Taste changes and smells.  What can I do about nausea? Nausea is different for every person who experiences this symptom. The key is to prevent nausea from occurring. A variety of medications and behavioral therapies can be used to manage nausea.  Here are some tips you might find helpful: ACTIVITY  Get plenty of rest.   Decrease unnecessary motion.   Wear loose fitting clothes, be comfortable.   Have fresh air with a fan or window open.   Brush your teeth after meals.   Use mouthwashes that do not contain alcohol to improve the taste in your mouth.  DIET  Avoid large meals. Try to eat several, small frequent meals to help maintain calories without overfilling the stomach.   Eat slowly.   Sip fluids slowly, such as ginger ale or ginger tea no sooner than 2 hours after the last vomiting episode.   Try cool or cold foods, if hot food is unappealing.  Some suggestions include Jell-O, cottage or ricotta cheese, yogurt, pudding, sherbet, cold sandwiches, pasta or potato salads, and popsicles.   Try eating dry foods, such as crackers, bagels, and toast.   Bland foods work well from many people: try toast, cereals, yogurt, ices, cookies, pretzels and skinless cooked chicken.   Avoid sweet, fried, or fatty foods.   Avoid gas-producing vegetables, like broccoli, cauliflower, cucumbers, green peppers, brussel sprouts, and sauerkraut.   Avoid acidic foods such as salsa, tomatoes, citrus fruits and citrus fruit juices, or vinegar.   Chew gum or suck on hard candy.   Try eating most foods during the time of when you are able to eat better.  Many people find that breakfast time is best.   Avoid alcoholic beverages.   Avoid your favorite foods if you are nauseated.  You may start to associate your favorite foods with feeling sick if you eat them while nauseated.   Do not force yourself to eat.   Avoid food aromas and other strong odors.  MEDICATION  Treat heartburn and gas with antacids.   Learn your schedule for taking your anti-nausea medications and stay on it.  Do not decide to stop the medicine if you are feeling well.  Nausea can come back.  PSYCHOLOGICAL  Try using television or music as a distraction.   Try behavioral therapies and techniques that can be helpful in treating nausea and vomiting include:   Acupuncture. Acupressure. Guided imagery. Music therapy. Muscle relaxation. Counseling, support, and structured educational interventions. What can family members and friends do to help with my nausea?

What should I report to my healthcare provider about my numbness and tingling?  What things should I discuss with my healthcare provider about my numbness and tingling (Peripheral Neuropathy)?   Where can I get more information? References Supportive evidence-based practice What is numbness and tingling (Peripheral Neuropathy)? Numbness and tingling is swelling or damage to the nerve fibers.  It is associated with some cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiation. In some people, the cancer itself may contribute to numbness and tingling if it is compressing nerve endings. Numbness and tingling is a sensation that generally occurs in the hands and feet.  It can interfere with walking, driving, ability to sense temperature differences, and other normal daily activities. People experience numbness and tingling differently.  Symptom specifics, such as how severe it is or how long it lasts, will vary from person to person.  It is very important that all symptoms are reported to your healthcare provider immediately. Early reporting of numbness and tingling is the best way to decrease the severity and prevent further complications.  How do people describe numbness and tingling (Peripheral Neuropathy)? People use many different words to describe this sensation. Most people feel it in the hands and feet first, beginning with their fingertips and toes. The tingling, pain, or numbness may move up from the fingers to the hands and from the toes to the feet.  This is called a \"stocking-glove\" pattern (similar to how a person puts on gloves and stockings).  The most common symptoms people describe are these:  Tingling - a feeling of needles and pins, and burning.   Feeling a sudden, sharp \"stabbing\", pricking or \"electric shock\" pain feeling.   Decreased ability to feel changes in temperature, touch, pain or vibration.   Loss of balance, difficulty walking like slapping your feet, or stumbling and falling when your toes hit an uneven surface.   Clumsiness or dropping things.   Difficulty picking up objects, buttoning clothing, brushing teeth, writing or using a fork or spoon.   Hearing loss or ringing in the ears.   Jaw pain.   Constipation, difficulty urinating.   Weakness in arms or legs and other muscles.   Blurred vision, hoarseness or difficulty speaking.  Although some symptoms may develop suddenly after your treatment, the numbness and tingling may gradually build up.  It can worsen with each chemotherapy treatment. Usually it is usually more intense right after a treatment and tends to get better just before the next one. Symptoms are normally at their worse 3-5 months after your last treatment.  They may gradually get better over the next several months. However, in some cases it may not get better or totally go away.  What causes numbness and tingling (Peripheral Neuropathy)? Numbness and tingling is the most common symptom of peripheral nerve damage. Some of the most common chemotherapy drugs known to cause peripheral neuropathy include:   Vincristine (Oncovin&#174;)   Vindesine (Eldisine&#174;)   Vinorelbine (Navelbine&#174;)   Vinblastine (Velban&#174;)   Platinol (Cisplatin&#174;)   Paraplatin (Carboplatin&#174;)   Eloxatin (Oxaliplatin&#174;)   Paclitaxel (Taxol&#174;)   Docetaxel (Taxotere&#174;)   Bortezomib (Velcade&#174;)   Thalidomide   Procarbazine (Matulane&#174;)   Cytarabine (ARA-C&#174;)   Vespide (Etoposide&#174;, vp-16)   Alfa-interferon  High doses of chemotherapy tend to cause more numbness and tingling.  Individuals at the greatest risk of developing numbness and tingling with chemotherapy are those people who already have conditions that increase their risk, these include:   Diabetes   Alcoholism   Severe malnutrition   Advanced age   Prior chemotherapy  What can I do about numbness and tingling (Peripheral Neuropathy)? Although most of the time it is not possible to prevent early nerve damage, it is possible to prevent it from getting worse. The most important thing that you can do is to tell your healthcare provider immediately if feel any numbness and tingling. Then, you and your healthcare provider can talk about whether your treatment should be changed. \r\nHere are some tips you might find helpful: ACTIVITY  Pay close attention when you walk.  You may be able to tell if your toes and feet have been affected. This can help you avoid falls.   Turn lights on before entering a room.   Keep rooms bright enough that you can see all areas where you need to walk or do other activities.   Keep a night light in your room and along the path you walk during the night if you get up.   Move furniture at home so you have a clear pathway.   Remove objects from the floor to help prevent falls, such as clutter or throw rugs.   Avoid slippery wet floors.  Wipe up liquids immediately.   Put a non-slip rubber mat or self-stick strips on the floor of the bathroom or shower.   Use over-the-tub handgrips or install shower grips.   Use soap dispensers instead of bar soap, which can easily slip out of your hands.   Use a non-breakable water thermometer to check your bath or dishwater temperature before you wash dishes or bathe.  Mae sure that water is not hotter than 110 F (43.3C).  This will help prevent injury to your kin.    This is important if you are having trouble feeling changes in temperature.   Avoid extremes of hot and cold.   Avoid sudden chilling, such as reaching into a refrigerator or freezer, air conditioning in the summer, drinking ice-cold drinks, eating ice cream or other cold foods and cold showers.   Try wearing gloves and a scarf when opening a refrigerator or going into an air-conditioned room.   Use rubber gloves to wash dishes.  The gloves will protect your hands from very hot water.   Use a potholder when cooking to avoid further injury to nerve endings.   Use a cane or walker if you are unsteady when walking or have weakness.   Wear sturdy shoes.  Do not wear slippers and running shoes with thick soles.   Wear gloves and warm cotton socks in the winter.   Inspect your skin daily for abrasions, burns, and cuts.  Carefully inspect your arms, legs, fingers and toes.   Consider having manicures if your hands are painful -- but do not have your cuticles cut.  This can increase your risk for infections.   Pay special attention when trimming your toenails.  You may not feel small cuts on your toes.  Have a pedicure or see a podiatrist for foot care.   Physical therapy may help with strengthening weak muscles.   Exercise- especially swimming and walking.   Occupational therapy to assist with daily activities   Massage is relaxing, which can help decrease pain.  COMMUNICATION  Discuss with your healthcare provider your current driving skills and ability to feel the gas and brake pedals, steering wheel and any changes in reaction time.   Your healthcare provider may refer you to occupational therapy to help with assistive devices, such as special pens, pencils and utensils.  These assistive devices are designed so that you can hold them more easily.  You may also need clothes and shoes with Velcro&#174; straps and jewelry without fasteners. Inspect your skin daily for abrasions, burns and cuts; especially your arms, legs, fingers and toes.  DIET  Avoid cold beverages, chewing ice or using straws.   Drink at least 6-8 glasses of water a day to prevent constipation.  Eat a high fiber diet.  Talk to your healthcare provider about taking a stool softener or a laxative is you become constipated.  PSYCHOLOGICAL  Deep breathing, relaxation, and guided imagery can help with pain  How is numbness and tingling (peripheral neuropathy) managed? Medications Your healthcare provider may order a medication to help manage the pain and discomfort associated with peripheral neuropathy. Some to the medications that might be prescribed include:   Antidepressants may be used if your primary symptoms are tingling and burning pain. The use of antidepressants does not mean that your pain is imagined, or that you are depressed.   Antiseizure medication is commonly used if your primary symptoms include sharp, stabbing pains.   Topical creams are to be rubbed on the painful parts of the hands and feet. The most commonly used cream is Capsaicin (Zostrix&#174;) made of chili pepper extract. The cream may burn when first applied to the skin but the burning passes with continued use.   Pain medication may be helpful when used with the antidepressants or anti-seizure medications. Lidocaine patches have a numbing effect and are placed directly on the skin over the painful areas.  Be sure to talk to your healthcare provider before starting any over the counter or other medication. Some medications may interact with your treatment, or with the drugs that you are taking to improve your numbness and tingling. You should never take any medications, herbal remedies, or other over the counter substances without talking to your healthcare provider first.  Non-medication Several non-medication approaches have been reported to help people with numbness, tingling and pain these include:   Deep breathing, relaxation and guided imagery helpful particularly to with pain.   Acupuncture.   Physical therapy may help with strengthening weak muscles.   Exercise -- especially swimming and walking.   Occupational therapy to assist with daily activities.   Massage is relaxing, which can help decrease pain.   Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) is a method of applying a gentle electric current to the skin to relieve pain.  What can family members and friends do to help me with my numbness and tingling? Ask family members and friends to:  Prepare meals for you.   Help with daily household chores such as gardening or dishwashing.   Help with dressing and shopping to purchase shoes and clothes with Velcro&#174; closures.   Get objects off the floor and make sure rugs are taped securely to the floor.   Help insert thermometers in sinks and tubes.   Install brighter light bulbs and make sure that all pathways are well lit.   Buy liquid soap in a dispenser instead of bar soap.   Help with transportation.   Do exercises with you, such as walking to improve strength, balance and coordination.  How can I talk to my family members about my numbness and tingling (Peripheral Neuropathy)? Here are some ideas that may help you talk to family members and friends:  Be open and honest when telling family members and friends about difficulties you have with numbness and tingling.   Ask family members and friends for suggestions to help you function as close to your normal activity level as possible.   Tell family members and friends how the numbness and tingling is affecting your emotions and life.   Ask family members and friends how the numbness and tingling is affecting them.   Talk to your family and friends about any concerns regarding your safety or any help you need to perform your daily activities.  What should I report to my healthcare provider about my numbness and tingling? If you experience any of the following symptoms, report them to your healthcare provider:  Changes in physical function, pain, numbness, prickling or tingling that interfere with your ability to care for yourself.   Moderate to severe weakness in your arms and legs that make it difficult to do daily activities.   Severe numbness, pain, burning or tingling in your hands or feet that make it difficult to do daily activities.

What can family members and friends do to help me with my pain? How can I talk to my family members about my pain? What should I report to my healthcare provider about my pain?  What things should I discuss with my healthcare provider about pain?  Where can I get more information? References Supportive evidence-based practice What is pain? Pain is an unpleasant and uncomfortable feeling and emotional response related to actual (or possible) tissue damage. It is a hard symptom to understand. Pain is whatever a person says it is, happening whenever he/she says it does.  Pain can decrease appetite and activity levels, make sleeping difficult, and cause anxious or depressed feelings.  There is no need for anyone to be in constant pain.  Your healthcare provider can and should help you control your pain. How do people describe pain? People describe pain in many ways.  Pain can be described as aching, gnawing, and concentrate in on area.  Pain can also be vague and be localized in a general area of the body.  It can be sharp and intense, tingling or numbing. Pain can also be described as burning. It can come on suddenly or gradually. Pain that lasts for a period of time is chronic pain.  People can also have periods of very intense acute pain.  What causes pain? There are many causes of pain. Cancer can grow and press into surrounding tissue, causing pain.  Cancer can also spread to other areas of the body, causing new pain.  Pain can result from tissue damage during surgery, or pressure on nerves, such as compression caused by a tumor. Cancer drugs can damage the nerves in fingers, hands, toes and feet.  Even mouth sores can cause pain. What can I do about pain? Every person experiences pain differently.  Cancer pain is controllable in more than 90% of cases.  Some pain may be difficult to control, however there are things that can be done to allow you to function.  Beginning a pain management program early will help you to keep doing your daily activities. Here are some tips you might find helpful: ACTIVITY  Rate your level of pain on a scale of 0-10 (0 = none, 1-3 = mild, 4-6 = moderate, and 7-10 = severe).   Keep a diary to keep track of your pain experience.  Include in your diary: where and when the pain occurs, how long it lasts, what makes it worse, things that relieve the pain (such as heat, ice or drugs), and the length of time it took for the pain-relieving method to work.  This information may help your healthcare provider manage your pain.   Try putting heat or cold on the area of pain. Wrap your heating pad or ice pack in a towel to protect your skin.   Use pillows to keep pressure off your area of pain.  COMMUNICATION  Ask your doctor for something to control any nausea associated with taking pain medication.  Some people are nauseated even when taking the correct dose of pain medication.  MEDICATION  Take the pain medicine exactly as prescribed.  For chronic pain, medications should be given round-the-clock on a schedule instead of only when the pain is severe.  Check with your healthcare provider if the schedule needs to be adjusted.   Do not wait until your pain is severe to take your pain medication.   Avoid crushing or breaking your pain pills unless you check with your healthcare provider.  Do not break any long acting or time-release form of pain medications.   Ask to be put on a preventative laxative regimen if you are taking opioid pain medication.  This will help you to avoid constipation.   Do not drive or operate any equipment until you are sure of the effects from the medication.  Pain medication can make you dizzy, drowsy, or sleepy.   This may get better after a few days, but you may need help getting up or walking.   Keep at least one-week supply of pain medication on hand.  Let your doctor or nurse know well in advance when you need more medication.   Avoid suddenly stopping any of your pain medicines.  Instead, reduce the dosage gradually as the pain decreases.  Talk with your healthcare provider before stopping any medication.  How is pain managed? Pain can be managed with medication regimens, non-medication approaches, or a combination of both.  Talk to your healthcare provider about which pain management strategies are right for you. \r\n\r\n Medications  You should never take any medications, herbal remedies, or other over-the-counter substances without talking to your healthcare provider first.  Some medications may interact with your treatment or with the drugs that you are taking to decrease your pain include:  Mild pain (non-prescription)  Aspirin&#174;   Tylenol&#174;   Advil&#174;   ibuprofen&#174;   Motrin&#174;  Your doctor may order medication to help manage the pain.  Some of the medications that might be used include (prescription required): Moderate to severe pain (opioids/narcotics)  Codeine (with Aspirin&#174; or Tylenol&#174;)   Oxycodone (with Aspirin&#174; or Tylenol&#174;)   Hydrocodone (with Aspirin&#174; or Tylenol&#174;)   Morphine   Hydromorphone   Dilaudid   Methadone   Fentanyl  Steroids, antidepressants and anti-seizure medications are also commonly used for moderate to severe pain control. If you are having problems swallowing pills or are nauseated, many of these medications come in liquid form or patches you can place on your skin.  For people that need multiple doses of narcotic pain medication, a doctor may prescribe a long acting or time-released medication.  Do not be afraid to take opioids because you think you might become hooked or addicted.  This problem is very rare in cancer patients, occurring in about 1 in 10,000 patients, \r\n\r\n Non-medication Several non-medication approaches that have been reported to help people with pain include:   Deep breathing, relaxation and guided imagery are particularly helpful with pain.   Acupuncture.   Physical therapy may help with strengthening weak muscles.   Exercise, especially swimming and walking.   Occupational therapy to assist with daily activities.   Massage is relaxing, which can help decrease pain.   Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) is a method of applying a gentle electric current to the skin to relieve pain.   Counseling or support groups.   Distraction activities, such as watching TV or listening to music.  \r\n\r\n What can family members and friends do to help me with my pain? Ask family members and friends to:   Help position you so you can be more comfortable.   Call your healthcare provider if your pain medication is not helping to decrease your pain.   Call your healthcare provider if your pain level is above 5.   Give you a gentle backrub with warmed lotion.   Watch for confusion and dizziness, especially after new medicines are started or when doses are changed.   Encourage pleasant distractions, such as watching movies, or playing games.   Offer plenty of fluids and foods with fiber.   Remind you to take your pain medication as prescribed.  Help you to stay on schedule.   Help you to remember to take the stool softeners and laxatives that your healthcare provider suggested to prevent constipation.   Help you keep an updated list of all the medication you are on, and any side effects that you have had with any of your medications.  \r\n\r\n How can I talk to my family members about my pain? Here are some ideas that may help you talk to family members and friends:  Try saying where your pain is, and how severe your pain is on a 0-10 (0 = none, 1-3 = mild, 4-6 = moderate, and 7-10 = severe).  If the pain is a 5 or above, contact your healthcare provider.   Use descriptive words, such as sharp or aching, to describe your pain to family members and friends.   Tell your family members and friends how many hours per day you have the pain.   Tell your family members and friends how your pain is affecting your emotions.   Ask family members and friends for suggestions to help manage your pain.  What should I report to my healthcare provider about my pain? If you experience any of the following symptoms, report them to your healthcare provider:  Pain not relieved by current medication.   Any pain that is a 5 or higher on a 0-10 scale.   Number of hours per day you have pain and how long it lasts after taking something for relief.   Pain that is new or different from your last visit to your healthcare provider.   Pain with a cough or fever greater than 100.4 degrees Farenheit (38.0 C) for more than 24 hours.   Unbearable side effects to pain medication, such as uncontrolled constipation.   Pain along with fatigue, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal bloating.   Pain that is getting worse despite using a pain medication schedule (taking pain medication throughout the day and night).   Location of pain.   Unable to take anything by mouth, including the pain medicine.   Confusion or becoming disoriented.   Any questions about taking medication.  \r\n\r\n What things should I discuss with my healthcare provider about pain? If you are experiencing pain, you should discuss the following with your healthcare provider at your next appointment:  Who will be managing my pain medications?   What is causing my pain?   Do you have information or counseling available to help manage my pain?   How much medicine should I take? How often?   If my pain is not relieved, can I take more? If the dose should be increased, by how much?   Should I call you before increasing the dose?   What if I forget to take it, or take it late?   Should I take my medicine with food?   What do I take to prevent constipation?   How long does it take the medicine to start working (called \"onset of action\")?   Is it safe to drink alcoholic beverages, drive, or operate machinery after I have taken pain medicine?   What are the side effects and how can I prevent them?  \r\n\r\n Where can I get more information?

What things should I discuss with my healthcare provider about my rash? Where can I get more information? References Supportive evidence-based practice What is a rash? A rash is any change in the skin that alters its appearance or texture. It may affect all of the skin or be localized to one part of the body. Rashes can irritate the skin by causing it to itch, change colors, become warm, bumpy, dry, crack or blister. Swelling and pain can also occur. If you are receiving chemotherapy it is important to let your healthcare provider know when you develop a rash. It will be important for you to describe the appearance of the rash, where it is located, when it first appeared, and any symptoms you are experiencing. How do people describe rash? Rash is a general term for a skin reaction. There are many terms used to describe what the rash looks like such as:  Erythematous - Redness.   Macular - Small, distinct, flat areas.   Papular - Small raised lesions.   Macular-Papular - Usually bright red in color. The skin may feel hot, burning, or itchy.   Hives (uticaria) - Round, raised, itchy, or red blotches, which may be pale in the center and red around the outside.   Follicular eruptions - Tiny sacs on the skin surface from which hair grows.  These eruptions look very similar to acne. Some doctors call it an acne-like rash. Follicular eruptions are raised and can be filled with pus have a yellow drainage.   Itching (or pruitis) - A peculiar tingling or uneasy irritation of the skin that causes a desire to scratch the affected area. Itching may be over the whole body (generalized), or only in a particular location (localized).   Flushing - A temporary redness of the face and neck caused by swelling of the blood vessels.   Blistering - Round raised areas of fluid under the upper layer of the skin, which can weep or drain clear fluid.   Honey yellow crusting - Yellowish-brown crust over the red eruptions with oozing of fluid from lesions may indicate a bacterial infection.  What causes a rash? It is very important that you understand the side effects of your chemotherapy treatment. Many chemotherapy drugs can cause rashes and skin changes. Some of the skin reactions can develop immediately during treatment or within the first 36 hours after receiving your treatment. This is an acute allergic or hypersensitivity reaction causing hives, flushing and itching. It is very important that you let your healthcare provider know immediately if you experience this type of rash. This is your body\'s protective immune response to a foreign substance that has entered the body, such as chemotherapy. This is not a common reaction, but is more common with certain chemotherapy drugs, such as, Paclitaxel, Bleomycin, L-Asparaginase, Docetaxel, Cisplatin, Carbotaxol and Monoclonal Antibodies.  Ask your healthcare provider if your chemotherapy might cause a reaction Allergic drug rashes can also be delayed developing within days or weeks after your treatment.  This type of skin rash usually develops on the back of the body. The arms and legs are often involved however, the face is not usually affected. This rash is usually bright red in color, and the skin will feel hot and burning. It is very important to let your healthcare provider know all the medications that you are currently taking and whether you have any medication allergies or history of allergic reactions. There are many new chemotherapy drugs that are associated with rashes. Scientists have developed numerous new drugs that appear to be effective treatments for many different kinds of cancer. Known as  targeted treatments , these drugs are designed to prevent cancer cells from getting nourished, growing, dividing, and possibly spreading.  Targeted treatments are different than chemotherapy.  Unlike chemotherapy, which can harm healthy cells as it kills cancer cells, targeted treatments focus on blocking cancer cell growth and killing cancer cells.  Treatments may be given in combination with chemotherapy or alone as a single treatment. In particular, one type of targeted treatment blocks the epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs), which can cause rashes and dry skin.  These rashes are not an allergic response.  They are a side effect from the drug itself.  EGFR - blocking drugs that commonly cause a rash include Cetuximab (Erbitux&#174;), Erlotinib (Tarceva&#174;), Gefitinib (Iressa&#174;) and Panitumumab (Vectibix&#174;).  Another type of targeted treatment blocks the development of blood vessels that feed tumors.  It is called vascular endothelial growth factors receptors (VEGFRs).  VEGF - blocking drugs include Sorafenib (Nexavar&#174;) and Sunitinib (Sutent&#174;). These rashes usually appear within 1-3 weeks of treatment. The rash is characterized by an acne-like rash with pustules.  Generally, they first appear on the face, particularly around the nose or on the cheeks.  However, the rash may also appear on the back, arms and legs. The severity of the rash may come and go during your treatment. Typically the rash clears up within 1-2 months after your treatment is completed. The rash normally does not require you to stop your treatment. Some studies have suggested that the rash may actually be a positive sign that your body is responding to the drug.  It is very important that you notify your healthcare provider if this rash develops.  This rash is NOT acne.  Do not treat it with acne medication What can I do about rash? Here are some tips you might find helpful: ACTIVITY  Wear loose soft cotton clothing.   Use a mild moisturizing soap without perfumes when bathing.  Examples of mild moisturizing soaps are Dove&#174;, Ivory&#174; Skin Cleansing Liquid Gel, Cetaphil&#174;, Neutrogena&#174; and Aveeno&#174;.   Pat skin gently after washing the area with a clean soft towel or washcloth.   Avoid exposing your skin to temperature extremes.  Try not to use hot lamps, ice packs, heating pads and electric blankets.   Treat dry skin with emollient lotions, such as: Eucerin&#174; Cream, Cetaphil&#174; Cream, Bag&#174; Balm, Udder&#174; Cream, Zim\'s&#174; Crack Cream, Aquaphor&#174; ointment, Vanicream&#174;, Neutrogena&#174;, or Vaseline&#174; Intensive Care (dye free & alcohol free).   Treat itchy skin with the emollient lotions listed above and Aveeno&#174; Baths, Sarna&#174; Ultra Cream, Regenecare&#174; Gel, Gold Bond&#174; Powder and Sweet cream.   Strong gloves will help avoid skin contact with friction and harsh chemicals, which can further damage your skin.  Wear light cotton gloves when gardening or doing outdoor work.  Put on rubber or latex gloves before washing dishes.   Use Band-Aid&#174; brand Liquid Bandage, Bag&#174; Balm, and Zim\'s&#174; Crack Cream for cracks and fissures.   For inflammation around your fingernails try soaking your fingertips in a solution of white vinegar diluted 1:10 in tap water for 5 minutes a day.   Wash your clothes and other fabrics that come in direct contact with your skin in mild hypoallergenic detergents.  Deft and Tide make a hypoallergenic laundry soap.  Read the label to be sure that buy the correct type.   Avoid tanning beds.   Wear sunscreen everyday, even on cloudy days.  Your sensitivity to the sun has increased.  Wearing long sleeves and long pants can help but you still need to wear sunscreen.  A new ingredient called Helioplex keeps a sunscreen from breaking down.  Helioplex is gentle on sensitive skin and can be found in several Neutrogena sunscreens, including Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry Tough Sunblock SPF 55.   Wear a hat.   DO NOT treat the rash with acne medication such as Clearasil&#174;, Oxy&#174;, Benzoyl&#174; Peroxide&#174;, or Stridex&#174;.   Makeup is safe to use, but avoid makeup products that contain many ingredients.   Avoid lotions, creams and soaps that contain alcohol, perfumes, or dyes.  These ingredients may increase dryness and can cause further skin irritation.  COMMUNICATION  Call your healthcare provider immediately if a new rash appears before your next appointment.  DIET  Drink 8 (8oz.) glasses of water or other non-caffeinated drinks every day.  Avoid caffeine (i.e. colas, coffee) when possible.  Caffeine can cause dehydration.  MEDICATION  Ask your healthcare provider if a topical or oral medication is right for you. They may be able to prescribe one.  What can family and friends do to help with my rash? Ask family and friends to:  Help select proper lotions for dryness and itching.   Help remind you to wear sunscreen when outside.   Help apply medications and lotions to skin if necessary.   Assist you with chores around the house.   Help bathing to keep skin clean.   Help by letting your healthcare provider know if rashes or itching occur.  How can I talk with my family members and friends about my rash? Here are some ideas that may help you talk to family members and friends:  Describe how having a rash makes you feel.   Ask your family member how your rash is affecting them.   Ask family members for support or suggestion to help cope with the rash.   Tell family members what feels good and helps with the rash.   Try describing how the itching or rash may interfere with your usual activities.  Drugs that may be prescribed by your healthcare provider  Topical steroid creams are currently not recommended.   Topical antibiotics creams may include:   Clindamycin Erythromycin  Antibiotics taken by mouth in pill form may include:   Tetracyline Minocylcline Doxycycline  Mild, localized itching may benefit from a topical antihistamine cream like Benadryl&#174;. Oral antihistamine drugs, such as, Benadryl&#174;, Claritin&#174;, or Allegra&#174; are all available over the counter and can be helpful for severe itching.  If the rash hurts, pain medications may be prescribed.  What should I report to my healthcare provider about my rash? If you experience any of the following symptoms, report them to your healthcare provider:  Report all rashes even if they are not causing you discomfort. Not all rashes require treatment.   Any new fever reading above 100.9 (38.3), or a temperature higher than 100.4 F (38.0 C) that lasts for more than an hour. Make sure that when you take your temperature you have not had any hot drinks within the last 10-15 minutes.   Increase warmth or redness to the skin area.   Any drainage or pus from the rash.   A rash that will not go away or becomes infected.   Any blisters that formed.   Cracking or peeling fingernails.   Dry nagging cough.   Severe or unmanageable itching.   Hives, flushing and difficulty breathing. Seek help immediately and notify your healthcare provider.   If your rash worsens or if the medications prescribed by your healthcare provider are not working.  What things should I discuss with my healthcare provider about my rash? If you are experiencing a rash, you should discuss the following with your healthcare provider at your next appointment:  Am I at risk for developing an allergic reaction or rash with my treatment?   Do I need to take any medications prior to my treatment to reduce my risk of reaction?   Do I stop taking my chemotherapy if I develop at rash?   Can I wear make-up if I develop a rash?

How can I talk with my family members and friends about my shortness of breath? What should I report to my healthcare provider about my shortness of breath? What things should I discuss with my healthcare provider about shortness of breath?  Where can I get more information? References What is shortness of breath? Dyspnea or shortness of breath is difficulty breathing or trouble catching your breath. Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing sometimes occurs when the body is not getting enough oxygen.  How do people describe shortness of breath? Some people describe it as a feeling of working very hard to breathe.  Others describe it as \"air hunger\" or a feeling of suffocation.  When people are short of breath, they are unable to do their usual activities. They tire more easily. Shortness of breath can make it difficult to talk, eat meals, or sleep at night. What causes shortness of breath? People with cancer may experience shortness of breath because of: chronic lung disorders, fatigue, pneumonia, pain, immobility, malnutrition, obesity, stress, or anxiety. Shortness of breath can also result from surgery, anemia, side effects of chemotherapy or radiation therapy, tumors or fluid in the lungs.  These problems prevent the lungs from breathing in enough air and delivering oxygen to the bloodstream. What can I do about shortness of breath? Here are some tips you might find helpful: ACTIVITY  Plan your day to do important or fun activities first.   Limit unnecessary activity.   Do not lie flat on your back.  Prop your head up while in bed.  Pillows can be helpful.  Some people find it helpful to lie on their stomach.   Use oxygen as prescribed by your doctor.   Sit upright and lean forward with your forearms on a table, another piece of furniture, or your knees.   Try breathing techniques when having difficulty breathing.  One technique is to:   Breathe through your nose for a count of 2. Purse your lips, like you are going to blow out a match or candle. Breathe out through pursed lips for a count of 4. Repeat these steps until shortness of breath is relieved.  Do not smoke and avoid being around people who smoke.   Wear loose and easy to put on clothes.   Take part in activities such as board games, listening to music, watching TV, or reading.   Perform daily grooming activities (showering, shaving, brushing teeth, combing hair) while sitting down.   Take rest period during activities.  Pace your activities to provide rest periods.   Apply a cool washcloth on cheeks.   Try opening a window or turning on a fan.   Avoid warm temperatures, unpleasant odors and fumes.   Use a wheelchair as needed.   Wear slip on shoes.  Pull socks and shoes on while sitting.   Use special devices to pick up items on the floor or ground.   Move slowly and breathe deeply.   Remain physically active.  Do mild gently exercises, as tolerated.   Take your time when climbing stairs.  Match your breaths to the steps you take.  COMMUNICATION  Ask your healthcare provider about services, such as Meals on Wheels.  DIET  Eat 6 small meals a day rather than 3 large ones.   Be sure to keep up your fluid level up by drinking 8 glasses of water per day (8oz. each).  This is important if you are breathing through your mouth.   Avoid foods that are difficult to chew.   Use frozen-foods.  These meals are easy to make and take less energy to prepare.   Buy ready-made meals.  Many are nourishing and tasty.  MEDICATION  Take medications as prescribed that decrease shortness of breath.  PSYCHOLOGICAL  Remain calm and try to stay relaxed.   Do relaxation exercises to help improve your breathing.   Try to decrease your stress levels.  What can my family members and friends do to help me with my shortness of breath?

An increased pulse rate.   Pounding heart in the chest.   Unable to get out of bed for 24 hours.   Swelling in your ankles or calves.  \r\n\r\n It is important to note if the shortness of breath occurs after activity, or when you are resting. Tell your healthcare provider when the shortness of breath occurs.  \r\n\r\n What things should I discuss with my healthcare provider about shortness of breath?

Difficulty staying asleep (having nighttime awakenings lasting 30 minutes or more).   Waking up too early.   Non-refreshing or poor quality sleep.   Hypersomnia is different from fatigue. You may have hypersomnia if you are sleeping more than 10 hours per night and still sleep during the day.  How do people describe disturbed sleep? Disturbed sleep is often described as excessive fatigue or sleepiness. People who have it say that they have no desire to do anything, even activities that used to bring great pleasure. Not wanting to see or talk to friends or family is also a result of disturbed sleep. Disturbed sleep can change the way you think and feel about things. What causes disturbed sleep? Worrying about the diagnosis and treatment can make sleep difficult.  Other sleep disturbances include: pain, itching, hot flashes, night sweats, depression, and noisy environments.

How do I talk with my healthcare provider to get the information I need?  What should I tell my healthcare provider? What should I know about my cancer and treatment?   How do I call my healthcare provider?  Where can I get more information? References Why is it important to communicate with your healthcare providers? Almost everyone feels better and more in control of their treatment when they understand why it is being given, as well as side effects that may happen. However, many people have a difficult time talking with their healthcare provider. Some feel uncomfortable asking questions or talking about their illness and treatment because they\'re afraid they might look foolish or ask a silly question. Others may have difficulty because they see their healthcare provider as a powerful person. Some are afraid if they report too many things, their treatment will stop.  It is important to be open with your healthcare providers and talk with them about your concerns. How do I talk with my healthcare provider to get the information I need? It is reasonable to assume the medical staff wants to help you and would like to give you the information you need.  Buy a notebook and write down all the questions you want to ask. Include any symptoms you\'ve been experiencing and how they are impacting your daily activities.   Bring a friend or family member to your appointment to take notes or help you ask questions.   Speak frankly with your doctor. Express your feelings.  Let others know how you feel.   Take notes during the appointment.   Ask permission to tape record the visit so you can use it as a reminder at home.  What should I tell my healthcare provider? Different items to bring up with your healthcare provider:  Tell them about any problems. Examples are:   Symptoms to report - How often throughout the day/week they occur?  What makes it worse or better?  What you are doing for symptom relief?  Symptom severity - On a scale of 0-10 (0=no symptom to 10=worst imaginable symptom), how severe is the symptom?  Physical functioning problems - On a scale of 0-10 (0=no problem to 10=many problems functioning), are you having any problems functioning? What makes it worse or better?  Need for assistance with physical function or managing symptoms.  Problems with doing your daily activities.  Emotional problems, such as anger, sadness or anxiety.  Financial problems because of your cancer or cancer treatment.  When you have questions about what is happening to you.  When you have decisions to make.  Repeat what you understand about your cancer or cancer treatment.  Ask if what you said is correct.   Ask your healthcare provider to repeat anything you do not understand.   Partnership - you and your healthcare providers are partners in your treatment.  They can only help you if you let them know when you are having a problem.  What should I know about my cancer and treatment? There are many kinds of information that you need:  An understanding of your diagnosis and stage of disease.   Medications that are involved in your treatment.   Side effects to expect from treatment.   How to best keep track of treatment and side effects.   How long you will be on treatment.   How you might expect to respond to treatment.   Risks and benefits of treatment.   Other treatment that might be available.   When you should call your doctor or nurse.   Where you can go to get more information.   Where you can get support.   Understand that not all questions have answers.  How do I call my healthcare provider? If you feel the situation is an emergency or urgent and you cannot get the information you need, call the healthcare provider or an emergency room. To do this, use the word \"emergency\" in your question, and then be persistent until you have the information you need. Here are some examples of phrasing you might use:  I have an emergency (or urgent need) and wish to talk to a doctor.   I have a question about _______ and I\'m not sure if this is really an emergency. Who can help me?   I\'m very concerned about _______. I think it is an emergency.  There are five things you can do to improve your ability to get information you need. The following order is recommended.   Ask clear and specific questions.   Know the name and contact information of the person that you need to reach.   Learn who can answer your questions.   Ask the questions yourself.   Make a log or write questions down and bring to appointment.  Other hints for good communication:  Learn which staff members give different kinds of information to people with cancer.  For example, \"Who can tell me when I will be discharged?\"   No questions are stupid.   Some people feel that medical staff members are so important or so busy that they should not take up their valuable time with questions. This is not so! Medical staff members are there to help people by sharing information and answering questions.   Do not feel intimidated. You have a right to the information.   Think of other obstacles that could interfere with carrying out your plan.  Where can I get more information?

(100400100204, 'communication-family', 'Communication with Family and Friends Why is it important to effectively communicate with your family and friends? How can I effectively talk to my family and friends? What are some effective communication strategies? What can family members and friends do to help me communicate more effectively? How can I talk with my family members and friends about communicating more effectively?  When should I ask for Help? Where can I get more information?  References Why is it important to effectively communicate with your family and friends? The experience of cancer (or any life-threatening illness) affects the entire family, as well as friends and co-workers. Even though you are the one coping with cancer, receiving medications, or having the surgery, your family, friends, and co-workers go through the treatments as well. Spouses or partners can sympathetically suffer the same nausea or pain. Children and parents face uncertainty and fear, and co-workers and friends have to deal with crises and interrupted schedules. Ask for help-everyone needs support.  How can I effectively talk to my family and friends? You do not have to face the cancer alone. Call your friends, family, and anyone else who supports you. Even if you are coping well and able to function, the additional stress of the disease and its treatment puts a strain on the body. There are no disadvantages to having support in place in case you need it. Asking for help is a sign of strength and allows you to take control. If asking for help is difficult for you, practice saying the words in front of the mirror. This technique may make you feel more comfortable asking for what you want or need.  What are some effective communication strategies? Here are some helpful tips to try when communicating with others:  Use \"I\" statements, such as \"I feel angry when...\", or \"I feel frustrated because...\", or \"I feel sad because...\".   Clarify statements, such as \"Correct me if I heard you wrong, but I thought you said...\".   Avoid using \"you\" statements, such as \"you always...\" or \"you never...\".   Schedule time every day to talk. You can minimize interruptions by not answering the doorbell, turning off the ringer on the phone, and turning off the TV.   Try to avoid serious discussion in the evening. This is when people are most likely to be tired and may not communicate clearly.   Restate your message and explain its meaning if you think your message was not received correctly.   Express your feelings and try to communicate openly.   Know what you want from people.  Set priorities before asking for help.   Make a list.  Here are some suggestions on what you could ask for:  Please help me with my shopping.   I need a hug.   I would like you to help my family by inviting them out and taking them places. I may be sick, but they are suffering too.   I might need transportation to treatment, to my doctor\'s office, or the store.   I\'d love it if you\'d water my flowers!   Please pray for me.   Talk to me about the future; hope is important to me.   I would love a call when you have a minute to just talk.   I enjoy getting mail or email.   Could you help me with chores? I still have dirty dishes, clothes and a house that needs cleaning.   Bring a positive attitude, it\'s catching.   Please help me feel good about myself.   Can you take my children or me somewhere? Be specific.   Offer to walk or feed my pet.   I\'d like you to just listen to me.   Appoint one of your friends or family to organize everyone else. You may not have to identify needs-they may do it for you.   Ask someone to do the computer or literature search on your diagnosis and treatment and then sort out what is good.   Make me laugh, tell me jokes, or read me funny stories. Cancer has not taken away my sense of humor.   Talk to me about my concerns for dying and how the cancer has changed me, without thinking I have a negative attitude.  What can family members and friends do to help me communicate more effectively? Ask family members and friends to:  Encourage you to tell them what you need.   Tell you when they think you are not being clear in telling them what you need.  How can I talk with my family members and friends about communicating more effectively? Here are some suggestions on how to talk to your family about effective communication:  Be open and honest with your family members and friends about how you feel.   Ask your family what they think is causing the breakdown in communication. What may help you to communicate more effectively?  When should I ask for help? It is never too early to ask for help.  If you can, ask in advance of needing the help. This gives your family and friends time to plan. Have friends and family assist you with:   Doctor appointments.   Chemotherapy or radiation therapy appointments.   Babysitting or taking kids to activities.   Share your, \"How family and friends can help\" list. See if they can come up with their own ideas.   Spiritual help-prayers, meditation, rituals, scripture reading, and getting to church or communion.   Emotional help, sharing, crying, and laughing.   Practical help-chores, transportation, or getting information.  Where can I get more information?

Accepting help means letting someone assist you to get what you need.  Why is it important to ask for or accept help? Asking people for help lets them know what you need. It allows them to help you in a specific way.  When you have symptoms and are tired and weak, accepting help may allow you to rest while getting your need met. How can I ask for help? As a cancer patient you are not alone. Call your friends, family, and anyone else who supports you. Everyone needs support. Even if you are coping well and able to function, the additional stress of the disease and its treatment can put a strain on your body, relationships, and quality of life. There are no disadvantages to having support in place in case you need it. Asking for help is a sign of strength and taking control. If asking for help is difficult for you, practice saying the words in front of the mirror. This is technique may make you feel more comfortable asking for what you want or need. How can my family members and friends help me? Here are some suggestions of things that you could ask your family, friends, and co-workers to do:   Get items on your shopping list.   Help your family by inviting them out and taking them places. (You may be sick, but they are also suffering.)   Water your flowers.   Talk to you about the future. Hope is important.   Call when they have a minute to just talk.   Send you a card to let you know they care.   Help you with household chores, such as dirty dishes, folding laundry, and cleaning up around the house.   Have a positive attitude, it\'s catching.   Take you or your children somewhere.   Drive you to your treatments or doctor\'s office.   Walk or feed your pet.   Listen to you/spend time with you.  It may be helpful to make a list of people and things that they are doing for you.  One of your friends or family can organize everyone else. When should I ask for help? It\'s never too early to ask for help.  If you can, ask in advance of needing the help.  This gives your family and friends time to plan, too. How do I handle well-wishers? Although friends, family, and well-wishers usually speak from their hearts and are often sincere, some comments can be difficult to take.  People may not know how to talk with you about your cancer or cancer treatment.  The first time that this happens, you may be surprised or shocked.  You can use this experience to learn how to handle these kinds of situations in the future. Constructive ways to deal with inappropriate questions or comments are to:  Ignore it, particularly when it is painful.   Answer questions in an evasive or general way.   Tell them that the question or comment hurt your feelings.  As is often the case, you may hear similar questions or comments time and time again.  Feeling hurt and angry by these questions or comments is okay.  Here are some tips that may be helpful:  Be straightforward and honest at whatever level feels comfortable to you. You can share as much or as little as you want.   Save the personal information for people who are close to you.   Decide in advance who gets what level of information about you, your cancer, and treatment.   When people touch you and say, \"How are you really feeling?\", you may want to respond by saying how you truly feel (if they are someone close to you).   Say you feel \"fine\" or \"okay\" (if they are someone who is a casual acquaintance). Be honest if you want help.   Be prepared to encounter people that are uncomfortable being around you.  They may try to avoid you or talking to you. Realize that you can\'t count on them.   Do not overlook someone you may not know well who is ready to be genuinely helpful.

Naps of 20 minutes at a time can really help, especially in the late morning or early afternoon - but avoid evening naps. Use your bed for sleeping only. Do not lie in bed reading, watching television, or surfing the Internet. Avoid long periods of bed rest. There should be no background noise (music or television) while you are sleeping. Set priorities: Plan to do important activities around times when you usually have the most energy. This is early in the day for most people. Ask for help with tasks that you do not need to do yourself. Some activities have to be done; others are not strictly necessary. Focus on necessary tasks. Nutrition: Eat a diet of fresh fruits and vegetables, low-fat milk products, and lean meat, fish, or chicken. Ask your doctor to help with your diet. Do not eat foods that are high in fat. Eat healthy snacks between meals (fruit, cereal bars, or mixed nuts) to maintain your energy. Drink 8 glasses of water or other non-caffeinated drinks daily (a total of about half a gallon). Avoid caffeine (colas, coffee, black tea, energy drinks) as far as possible. Physical activity: Plan to do some kind of mild physical activity for at least 30 minutes a day. Always warm up and cool down for 5 minutes. If this is too much, begin with shorter periods and try to work up to 30 minutes a day. Do activities that you enjoy. These activities help to deal with fatigue:\n	 Walk. Start with short distances. Increase your distance every month. Ride a bike. Use a regular or a stationary bike. Do strength training. Use weights or resistance bands. Ask your doctor for advice on how to do this activity or to recommend a specialist to help you with this. Do flexibility training. Include stretching with warm-ups and cool-downs. Again, ask your doctor\'s advice in this. Consider doing yoga or mind/body exercises like Qigong (breathing exercises) or Tai Chi. Do sitting exercises that include moving your joints and lifting light weights. These are especially helpful if you feel that you cannot handle a great deal of physical activity. If you can, simply spend time outside. You can do gardening or yard work, talk to your neighbors, watch your children, or walk in the park. Be cautious... ...if you have severe anemia (low red-blood cell count). Do not do any physical activity until your anemia improves. ...if you have a weakened immune system (low white blood cell count or a fever). Do not go to public gyms or other public areas until your white blood cell count is safe and you have not had a fever for at least 24 hours. ...if you are receiving radiation. Avoid swimming pools: chlorine irritates the skin, especially in the area of your body that is being treated with radiation. Keep your mind away from your fatigue. You can use a variety of distractions: music, nature, or television, even for background noise. Learn relaxation therapy, art, or music therapy.

Brush your gums and tongue to reduce the risk of fungal infection. Brush your teeth after every meal and at bedtime. Use nonabrasive toothpaste without whiteners, which may cause irritation. Avoid flavors, such as mint. Floss gently everyday with unwaxed dental floss. Stop flossing if you experience any bleeding or have low blood cell counts.
